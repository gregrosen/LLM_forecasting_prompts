Complex coordinated terrorist attack (CCTA)\n- United States\n- Foreign terrorist organization\n\nDefinitions:\n- Complex coordinated terrorist attack (CCTA): A type of terrorist attack that involves multiple attackers and targets, often using a combination of weapons, tactics, and explosives. It requires significant planning and coordination among the attackers and may involve simultaneous or sequential attacks.\n- United States: A country located in North America, consisting of 50 states, a federal district (Washington D.C.), and various territories. It is the third-largest country in the world by population and the largest economy.\n- Foreign terrorist organization: A group that engages in terrorism and is designated as such by the United States government. The designation makes it illegal for individuals or organizations in the U.S. to provide material support to the group.\n\nHistorical background:\n- CCTAs have been carried out by various terrorist groups, including al-Qaeda, ISIS, and the Taliban, in different parts of the world, including Europe, Africa, and Asia.\n- The United States has experienced several terrorist attacks, including the 9\/11 attacks in 2001, the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, and the Orlando nightclub shooting in 2016.\n- The U.S. government has designated many foreign terrorist organizations over the years, including al-Qaeda, ISIS, and Hamas.\n\nEconomic and societal considerations:\n- Terrorist attacks can have significant economic and societal impacts, including loss of life, property damage, and disruption of transportation and commerce.\n- The U.S. government has invested significant resources in counterterrorism efforts, including intelligence gathering, law enforcement, and military operations.\n- The fear and uncertainty caused by the threat of terrorism can also have psychological and social effects on individuals and communities.\n\nRelationship between the terms:\n- The question is asking whether a CCTA will occur in the United States that is either directed or inspired by a foreign terrorist organization and results in at least five fatalities.\n- The U.S. government has designated many foreign terrorist organizations, some of which have carried out CCTAs in other parts of the world.\n- The potential impact of a CCTA on the U.S. economy and society is significant and has implications for U.S. counterterrorism efforts.\n\nRank of importance:\n- Complex coordinated terrorist attack (CCTA): High importance, as it is the type of attack being predicted

Egypt: a country in North Africa, bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, Libya to the west, Sudan to the south, and the Gaza Strip and Israel to the east.\n- Ethiopia: a country in the Horn of Africa, bordered by Eritrea to the north, Sudan to the west, South Sudan to the south, Kenya to the south, and Somalia to the east.\n- Sudan: a country in North Africa, bordered by Egypt to the north, the Red Sea to the northeast, Eritrea and Ethiopia to the east, South Sudan to the south, the Central African Republic to the southwest, Chad to the west, and Libya to the northwest.\n- Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD): a hydroelectric dam project under construction on the Blue Nile River in Ethiopia. It is expected to be the largest hydroelectric power plant in Africa when completed.\n\nDates:\n- 1 September 2022: the deadline given by Ethiopia for the filling of the GERD reservoir.\n\nBackground:\n- The GERD project has been a source of tension between Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan since its inception, as all three countries rely heavily on the Nile River for their water supply. Egypt and Sudan are downstream countries and fear that the dam's construction will significantly reduce their water supply.\n- Negotiations between the three countries have been ongoing for years, with various agreements being reached and then later broken. The main point of contention has been the speed at which Ethiopia plans to fill the reservoir behind the dam, as this will affect the flow of the Nile downstream.\n\nImportant economic and societal considerations:\n- Water scarcity is a significant issue in all three countries, with Egypt and Sudan relying almost entirely on the Nile for their water supply. The GERD could potentially impact the amount of water available for agriculture, drinking, and industrial use in both countries.\n- Ethiopia sees the GERD as a crucial project for its economic development, as the dam will provide much-needed electricity for its population and could also be a source of revenue through the export of electricity to neighboring countries.\n\nRelationships:\n- The GERD project is at the center of the negotiations between Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan. The signing of an agreement governing the filling of the GERD reservoir would be a significant step towards resolving the ongoing dispute.\n- The negotiations are also influenced by broader geopolitical considerations, as each country seeks to protect its own interests while maintaining regional stability.\n\nRanking of importance:\n1.

Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office (TECRO): This is the de facto embassy of Taiwan in the United States, as the US does not officially recognize Taiwan as a sovereign state. TECRO serves as a liaison between Taiwan and the US in matters such as trade, culture, and education.\n\nDates:\n- 1 January 2023: This is the date mentioned in the question as the deadline for the potential name change.\n\nTerms:\n- Taiwan: Taiwan is an island nation located in East Asia. It has a complex political history, as it was previously a colony of Japan and later became a part of China. Today, it is a self-governing democratic country, but its sovereignty is disputed by China, which considers Taiwan to be a renegade province that must be reunified with the mainland.\n- Name change: This refers to the potential alteration of TECRO's name to include the word \"Taiwan.\" This has been a topic of debate for several years, as some believe that the current name does not accurately reflect Taiwan's status as a sovereign state.\n\nHistorical background:\n- TECRO was established in 1979, after the US switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China. As a result, TECRO serves as a representative office rather than an embassy.\n- The question of TECRO's name change has been a contentious issue for many years. Proponents of the change argue that the current name does not accurately reflect Taiwan's status as a sovereign state, while opponents argue that a name change could escalate tensions with China.\n\nEconomic\/societal considerations:\n- The relationship between Taiwan and China is a sensitive issue, and any changes to TECRO's name could have political and economic implications. China has previously used economic pressure to punish countries that recognize Taiwan, so a name change could potentially impact Taiwan's trade relations with other countries.\n- The US-Taiwan relationship is also important, as Taiwan is a key US ally in the region. Any changes to TECRO's name could potentially impact this relationship.\n\nRanking:\n1. Taiwan\n2. Name change\n3.

Taiwan - A self-governing democratic island located in East Asia. It has its own government, military, and economy. However, it is not recognized as a sovereign state by the People's Republic of China, which considers Taiwan a part of its territory.\n2. People's Republic of China (PRC) - A communist country located in East Asia. It claims Taiwan as a part of its territory and has threatened to use force to reunify with Taiwan if necessary.\n\nDates:\n1. 1 September 2022 - The deadline for the question.\n\nLocations:\n1. Taiwan - An island located in East Asia, separated from mainland China by the Taiwan Strait.\n2. Territorial waters - The area of the ocean surrounding Taiwan that is considered to be a part of its territory.\n\nBackground:\nThe relationship between Taiwan and the People's Republic of China has been strained for decades. Taiwan has been governed separately from mainland China since the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949, but the PRC continues to claim sovereignty over Taiwan. The two sides have engaged in a number of disputes and conflicts over the years, including military threats and economic sanctions.\n\nIn recent years, the PRC has been increasingly assertive in its claims to Taiwan, including conducting military exercises and sending military aircraft and ships near Taiwan's borders. Taiwan has accused the PRC of violating its sovereignty and endangering regional stability.\n\nEconomic and societal considerations:\nThe relationship between Taiwan and the PRC has significant economic and societal implications. Taiwan is a major exporter and investor in the region, and any conflict or tension could disrupt trade and investment flows. There are also significant cultural and social ties between Taiwan and mainland China, including shared language and heritage.\n\nRelationship between the terms:\nThe question asks whether Taiwan will publicly accuse the PRC of flying a military aircraft over its territory or territorial waters without permission. This would be a significant escalation of tensions between the two sides and could have significant implications for regional stability. The question implies that there have been previous incidents of the PRC violating Taiwan's sovereignty in this way.\n\nRank of importance:\n1. Taiwan and the PRC - The relationship between these two entities is at the heart of the question and is crucial for understanding the context and implications of any potential accusation.\n2. Territorial waters - The question specifically mentions this term, indicating that any accusation would relate to a violation of Taiwan's maritime borders.\n3. Military aircraft - The type of violation mentioned in the question is specific to military aircraft, suggesting that this is the most likely scenario for a potential accusation.\n4. Public accusation - The question asks specifically whether Taiwan will make a public accusation, indicating that this is an important aspect of the potential event.","examples":[{"example_question":"Before 5 August 2019, will the president submit to Congress a bill for implementation of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Between 1 July 2018 and 30 June 2019, will an armed group from the Democratic Republic of Congo engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in the Democratic Republic of Congo?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will North Korea launch a land-based intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) before 1 November 2017?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will there be a new episode of mass killing in Libya before 1 January 2017?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Before 2 October 2021, will the UN General Assembly recognize delegates from the National Unity Government (NUG) as representing Myanmar for the 76th General Assembly session?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.25},{"example_question":"Before 1 February 2020, will Ukraine adopt a new law giving or extending Donbas special status for local self-government?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the UN Security Council adopt a resolution concerning Somalia between 29 November 2017 and 22 December 2017 ?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Before 26 December 2020, will the Australian government accuse the Chinese government, by name, of being behind the \"copy-paste compromises\" cyberattacks?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Before 1 July 2018, will Ashraf Ghani cease to be president of Afghanistan?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Between 1 April 2019 and 31 March 2020, will an armed group from Bangladesh engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in Bangladesh?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will either Turkey or Russia officially suspend or cancel the Akkuyu nuclear power plant project before the end of 2016?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Before 15 February 2017, will the United Kingdom's Supreme Court rule that an additional act of the U.K. Parliament is required to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will Berlin's Humboldt Forum open to the general public before 1 August 2021?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will Dean Heller (R-NV) be re-elected this November?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.3},{"example_question":"Will the Trans-Pacific Partnership be ratified by Congress before 20 January 2017?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Between 1 January 2019 and 31 December 2019, will an armed group from Mali engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in Mali?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will Serbia and Kosovo reach a comprehensive normalization agreement  before 1 January 2020?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0,"example_context":"Entities:\n1.

Council of the European Union: The Council of the European Union is one of the main institutions of the European Union, consisting of representatives of the governments of the EU member states. It is responsible for adopting EU laws, coordinating policies, and concluding international agreements.\n- China: China is a country in East Asia, the world's most populous country, with a population of over 1.4 billion people. It is also the world's second-largest economy.\n- Xinjiang: Xinjiang is an autonomous region in northwest China, bordering several Central Asian countries. It is home to several ethnic minority groups, including the Uyghurs.\n\nDates:\n- 30 October 2021: The starting date for the period in question.\n- 31 December 2022: The end date for the period in question.\n\nTerms:\n- Restrictive measures: Restrictive measures are a form of sanctions imposed by the EU on countries or individuals to achieve specific policy objectives, such as promoting human rights or preventing terrorism. These measures can include travel bans, asset freezes, and trade restrictions.\n- Human rights violations and abuses: Human rights violations and abuses refer to actions that violate the fundamental rights of individuals, such as freedom of speech, religion, or assembly. These violations can include discrimination, torture, and forced labor.\n- Uyghurs: The Uyghurs are a predominantly Muslim ethnic minority group in China, mainly residing in the Xinjiang region. The Chinese government has been accused of committing human rights abuses against Uyghurs, including forced labor and mass detention.\n\nHistorical background:\nThe EU has been increasingly concerned about the human rights situation in Xinjiang, particularly regarding the treatment of Uyghurs. In March 2021, the EU imposed its first sanctions on China since the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, targeting four Chinese officials and one entity involved in the human rights abuses in Xinjiang. In response, China imposed counter-sanctions on several EU officials and entities. Since then, the EU has continued to raise concerns about the situation in Xinjiang and has hinted at the possibility of imposing further sanctions.\n\nSocietal and economic considerations:\nSanctions can have significant economic and societal impacts on both the target country and the imposing country. Imposing sanctions on China, the world's second-largest economy, could have significant economic consequences for EU member states. It could also impact EU-China relations and cooperation on issues such as trade and climate change. On the other hand, not imposing sanctions could be seen as condoning human rights abuses and could damage the EU's reputation as a defender of human rights.\n\nRelationship between the terms:\nThe question asks whether the Council of the EU will impose new restrictive measures on China over human rights violations and abuses in Xinjiang. The terms are related in that the restrictive measures would be imposed specifically in response to the human rights situation in Xinjiang, particularly the treatment of Uyghurs. The question also implies that there is some uncertainty about whether these measures will be imposed and when.\n\nRanking:\n- Human rights violations and abuses in Xinjiang: Very important, as this is the main issue at the heart of the question.\n- Council of the European Union: Important, as this is the entity responsible for imposing the restrictive measures.\n- Restrictive measures: Important, as these are the specific policy tool being considered in response to the human rights situation.\n- China: Important, as this is the target of the potential sanctions.\n- Xinjiang: Somewhat important, as it is the location of the human rights abuses and the main focus of the EU's concerns.","examples":[{"example_question":"Will Scott Morrison cease to be prime minister of

In March 2021, the EU imposed sanctions on four Chinese officials and one entity over their involvement in the human rights abuses in Xinjiang. However, it is difficult to predict whether the Council of the European Union will impose new restrictive measures on China over the same issue between 30 October 2021 and 31 December 2022. It will depend on various factors, including the ongoing situation in Xinjiang, the stance of other countries, and the EU's own priorities and policies. Therefore, the answer to this question cannot be determined with certainty."}

The People's Republic of China claims the islands as part of its territory. Tensions between Taiwan and China have been high in recent years, with China increasing its military presence in the region. In March 2021, Taiwan reported that China had flown 20 military aircraft into its air defense identification zone. In the past, Taiwan has accused China of landing military personnel on the Pratas Islands without authorization, so it is possible that it could happen again before 1 January 2023.

The index is calculated by the FAO and includes five commodity groups: cereals, vegetable oils, dairy, meat, and sugar.\n\nDates:\n- June 2022: The month for which the question is asking about the FAO Food Price Index.\n\nImportance rank of entities and dates:\n- FAO: High importance. The organization is responsible for calculating the Food Price Index and has a significant impact on international food security efforts.\n- Food Price Index: High importance. The index is a widely used indicator of global food prices and can have implications for food security, inflation, and economic growth.\n- June 2022: High importance. This is the specific time period for which the question is being asked.\n\nSocietal and economic considerations:\n- Food security: Changes in food prices can have significant impacts on food security, particularly for low-income households and those in food-insecure regions.\n- Inflation: Rising food prices can contribute to inflation, which can have broader economic impacts.\n- Economic growth: Changes in food prices can also impact economic growth, particularly for countries that rely heavily on agricultural exports or imports.\n\nRelationship between entities and dates:\n- The FAO calculates the Food Price Index on a monthly basis, so the June 2022 index will be part of a larger time series of food price data.\n- The Food Price Index is an important indicator for the FAO's efforts to improve food security and combat hunger, and changes in the index can have broader implications for economic growth and inflation.\n\nOverall, the entities and dates in the question are highly important and have significant implications for global food security, inflation, and economic growth.","examples":[{"example_question":"When will the 14-day average of COVID-19 hospitalized

Kassym-Jomart Tokayev: He is the current President of Kazakhstan since March 2019. Tokayev was elected as the successor of Nursultan Nazarbayev, who had been the President of Kazakhstan since the country gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.\n\nDates:\n- 7 July 2022: This is the date mentioned in the question as the deadline for the event to occur.\n\nLocations:\n- Kazakhstan: It is a country in Central Asia and the ninth-largest country in the world. Kazakhstan has vast mineral resources and is a major oil producer and exporter.\n\nDefinitions:\n- Flee: To leave a place quickly, especially because of danger or fear.\n- President: The head of state of a country, elected or chosen by the people or the legislature for a fixed term.\n\nHistorical Background:\n- Kazakhstan gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 and Nursultan Nazarbayev became the country's first president. Nazarbayev held the position for nearly 30 years until his resignation in March 2019. Kassym-Jomart Tokayev was elected as the new president in June 2019.\n\nImportant Economic and Societal Considerations:\n- Kazakhstan is a major oil producer and exporter, and its economy heavily relies on oil and gas exports. Any political instability or change in leadership could have an impact on the country's economy and its relations with other countries.\n- Kazakhstan is also a country with a complex political environment, and the government has been criticized for its human rights record and lack of political freedom.\n\nRelationship between Terms:\n- The question asks whether Kassym-Jomart Tokayev will either flee Kazakhstan or cease to be its president before 7 July 2022. The two options are related to each other in the sense that if Tokayev flees the country, he would no longer be its president. However, if he ceases to be the president due to other reasons such as impeachment or resignation, he may not necessarily flee the country.\n\nRank of Importance:\n- Kassym-Jomart Tokayev: Very important, as he is the subject of the question.\n- Kazakhstan: Important, as it is the location where the events in the question would take place.\n- 7 July 2022: Important, as it is the deadline mentioned in the question.\n- Flee\/cease to be president: Important, as they are the two possible outcomes mentioned in the question.","examples":[{"example_question":"Will Rishi Sunak cease to be the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer before 1 January 2022?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"I","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Between 1 January 2019 and 31 December 2019, will an armed group from Turkey engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in Turkey?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Before 18 December 2021, will the United Kingdom's Office for National Statistics (ONS) report that the percentage of working adults who \"Worked from home and didn't travel to work\" fell to 15% or lower?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Between 1 July 2019 and 30 June 2020, will an armed group from the Philippines engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in the Philippines?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will al-Shabaab attack a US diplomatic facility in Africa before 1 July 2018?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Between 1 April 2019 and 31 March 2020, will an armed group from Mali engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in Mali?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the UN declare a famine in any part of Somalia in 2017?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Between 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2018, will an armed group from Zimbabwe engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in Zimbabwe?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the EU lift visa requirements for Turkish citizens before July 2016?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"I","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Before 15 November 2019, will there be a lethal confrontation between the national military forces of Iran and Saudi Arabia either in Iran or at sea?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will there be a lethal confrontation in the South or East China Sea region involving China's and another country's national military forces or law enforcement personnel before 1 January 2017?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.3},{"example_question":"Between 1 July 2019 and 30 June 2020, will an armed group from the Central African Republic engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in the Central African Republic?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Before 5 August 2020, will Mark Esper cease to be the U.S. Secretary of Defense?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0,"example_context":"Mark Esper: Mark Thomas Esper is the current United States Secretary of Defense.

Nations, the European Union, and the US.\n- Rejoin: To become a member again, in this case, to rejoin the JCPOA.\n\nHistorical Background:\n- The JCPOA was first signed in 2015 during the Obama administration. However, in May 2018, the Trump administration withdrew from the JCPOA and re-imposed economic sanctions on Iran. \n- In response, Iran began violating the terms of the JCPOA by increasing its uranium enrichment levels and reducing compliance with other restrictions.\n- In 2021, the Biden administration expressed interest in rejoining the JCPOA, and negotiations have been ongoing since April of that year.\n\nEconomic\/Societal Considerations:\n- The JCPOA's lifting of economic sanctions had a significant impact on Iran's economy, leading to increased trade and investment opportunities. \n- The US's withdrawal from the JCPOA and re-imposition of economic sanctions had a significant impact on Iran's economy, leading to inflation, currency devaluation, and increased unemployment.\n\nRelationship between Terms:\n- The US withdrew from the JCPOA in 2018 and is now negotiating to rejoin it.\n- The JCPOA's impact on Iran's economy is a significant factor in Iran's willingness to comply with the agreement's terms and the US's willingness to rejoin the agreement.\n\nImportance Ranking:\n- JCPOA: 10\/10\n- US: 8\/10\n- 1 January 2023: 6\/10","examples":[{"example_question":"Between 1 October 2018 and 30 September 2019, will an armed group from Mali engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in Mali?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will any disputes over IAEA access to Iranian sites be referred to the Joint Commission before 1 July 2018?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"I","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the Scottish National Party win a majority of seats in the next Scottish Parliament election?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the New START treaty be extended by Russia and the U.S. before 6 February 2021?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"I","uncertainty":0.4},{"example_question":"Will legislation eliminating the unit limit per manufacturer for the U.S. federal electric vehicle tax credit become law before 1 January 2020?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will a Spanish prime minister win a vote of confidence before 1 October 2016?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0,"example_context":"Entities:\n- Spanish Prime Minister: The head of government of Spain, currently Mariano Rajoy.

Since the transition to democracy in the late 1970s, Spain has had a number of different governments, with several periods of political uncertainty and instability. \n\nIn December 2015, Spain held a general election which resulted in a hung parliament, with no party winning a clear majority.

Negotiations to form a government have been ongoing since then, but no agreement has been reached. The question of whether or not the Prime Minister will win a vote of confidence is closely tied to these negotiations and the broader political situation in Spain.\n\nEconomic and Societal Considerations:\nThe political situation in Spain has important economic and societal considerations. Spain has been struggling with high levels of unemployment, particularly among young people, and has been implementing austerity measures in an attempt to reduce its budget deficit. The ongoing political uncertainty has made it difficult to implement economic reforms and has raised concerns among investors and international organizations such as the European Union.\n\nRelationships between Terms:\nThe Spanish Prime Minister's ability to win a vote of confidence is closely tied to the broader political situation in Spain, including the ongoing negotiations to form a government and the country's economic and societal challenges. If the Prime Minister is able to win a vote of confidence, it could provide some stability and allow for greater progress on economic and political reforms. However, if he is unable to win the vote, it could lead to further political uncertainty and instability, with potentially negative consequences for the economy and society as a whole.\n\nRanking of Importance:\nAll the terms in the question are of high importance, as they are all central to understanding the political situation in Spain and the potential outcomes of the vote of

The question of whether or not the Prime Minister will win a vote of confidence is closely tied to these negotiations and the broader political situation in Spain.\n\nEconomic and Societal Considerations:\nThe political situation in Spain has important economic and societal considerations. Spain has been struggling with high levels of unemployment, particularly among young people, and has been implementing austerity measures in an attempt to reduce its budget deficit. The ongoing political uncertainty has made it difficult to implement economic reforms and has raised concerns among investors and international organizations such as the European Union.\n\nRelationships between Terms:\nThe Spanish Prime Minister's ability to win a vote of confidence is closely tied to the broader political situation in Spain, including the ongoing negotiations to form a government and the country's economic and societal challenges. If the Prime Minister is able to win a vote of confidence, it could provide some stability and allow for greater progress on economic and political reforms. However, if he is unable to win the vote, it could lead to further political uncertainty and instability, with potentially negative consequences for the economy and society as a whole.\n\nRanking of Importance:\nAll the terms in the question are of high importance, as they are all central to understanding the political situation in Spain and the potential outcomes of the vote of confidence."},"lowest_uncertainty":0.0,"highest_uncertainty":0.4,"average_uncertainty":0.032,"external_context":"The JCPOA, or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, is a nuclear agreement between Iran and six world powers, including the United States. The US withdrew from the JCPOA in 2018 under the Trump administration. Since then, there have been discussions about the US potentially rejoining the agreement. As of September 2021, there is no official confirmation on whether the US will rejoin the JCPOA before 1 January 2023. However, there have been recent talks between Iran and European countries about reviving the deal, with Iran focusing on sanctions and economic guarantees."}

Stream 2: \n- Definition: Nord Stream 2 is a natural gas pipeline project that aims to transport natural gas from Russia to Europe via the Baltic Sea.\n- Historical background: The Nord Stream 2 pipeline project was announced in 2015 as a joint venture between Russia's Gazprom and several European companies. The pipeline is intended to increase the amount of natural gas that can be transported from Russia to Europe, bypassing traditional transit routes through Ukraine and other Eastern European countries.\n- Economic considerations: The Nord Stream 2 pipeline is expected to have significant economic benefits for both Russia and Europe. Russia is one of the world's largest producers of natural gas, and the pipeline will allow the country to increase its exports to Europe. For Europe, the pipeline will provide a new source of natural gas, which is seen as a key part of the continent's energy mix.\n- Societal considerations: The Nord Stream 2 pipeline has been controversial due to concerns about Europe's dependence on Russian gas and the potential geopolitical implications of the project. Critics argue that the pipeline will increase Europe's reliance on Russian gas and give Russia greater leverage over Europe's energy supply. \n\nDelivery of natural gas:\n- Definition: Delivery of natural gas refers to the process of transporting natural gas from a source to a destination.\n- Historical background: Natural gas has been used for heating and cooking for centuries, but the modern natural gas industry began in the 19th century with the discovery of large natural gas fields in the United States. Since then, natural gas has become an important energy source around the world.\n- Economic considerations: The delivery of natural gas is a key part of the natural gas industry and is critical for ensuring that natural gas can be transported from production sites to consumers.

UN - The United Nations is an intergovernmental organization that was established in 1945 to promote international cooperation and resolve conflicts between countries.\n2. Afghanistan - A landlocked country located in South Asia, Afghanistan has been plagued by decades of war and political instability.\n\nDates:\n1. 2022 - The year in which the question is being asked.\n\nLocations:\n1. Afghanistan - The country in which the UN may declare a famine.\n\nImportant Terms:\n1. Famine - A widespread scarcity of food, often accompanied by malnutrition, starvation, epidemic diseases, and social disruption.\n2. Food insecurity - A lack of consistent access to enough food for an active and healthy life.\n3. Humanitarian aid - Assistance provided to people in need, often in response to a crisis or emergency situation.\n4. Conflict - A state of prolonged fighting between two or more groups, often resulting in displacement of people and disruption of access to basic needs such as food, water, and healthcare.\n\nHistorical Background:\nAfghanistan has a history of food insecurity due to decades of conflict and political instability. In recent years, the country has experienced droughts, floods, and other natural disasters that have further strained its food supply. The COVID-19 pandemic has also had an impact on the country's economy and food security. The UN has provided humanitarian aid to Afghanistan for many years, including food assistance, health care, and support for refugees.\n\nRelationships:\nThe UN's decision to declare a famine in Afghanistan may be influenced by various factors, including the country's political and security situation, the level of humanitarian aid provided, and the availability of food. The ongoing conflict in Afghanistan may hinder the delivery of aid and exacerbate food insecurity. The declaration of a famine may also have economic and societal implications, such as increased migration and social unrest.\n\nRanking:\n1. Afghanistan - Highly important as the location in question.\n2. Famine - Highly important as the main focus of the question.\n3. UN - Highly important as the organization that may make the decision.\n4. Food insecurity - Moderately important as a related concept to famine.\n5. Humanitarian aid - Moderately important as a potential solution to food insecurity.\n6. Conflict - Somewhat important as a potential factor affecting food security.","examples":[{"example_question":"Will the UN declare a famine in any part of Somalia in 2017?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.5},{"example_question":"Between 1 October 2017 and 30 September 2018, will an armed group from Mali engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in Mali?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0,"example_context":"Entities:\n1. Armed group from Mali\n2. Civilians in Mali\n\nArmed group from Mali:\nDefinition: An armed group in Mali refers to non-state actors who use violence to achieve their political objectives. These groups have emerged in Mali since the early 2000s, and their activities have escalated since the 2012 Tuareg rebellion and the subsequent French-led military intervention in 2013.\nHistorical background: The most prominent armed groups in Mali are the Islamist groups, such as Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), Ansar Dine, and the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa (MUJAO). These groups have been responsible for a series of attacks on Malian military and civilian targets, as well as on international peacekeeping forces in the country.\nEconomic\/societal considerations: The presence of armed groups in Mali has had a significant impact on the country's economy, particularly in the north, where the groups control smuggling routes and engage in other illegal activities.\n\nRank: 1st\n\nCivilians in Mali:\nDefinition: Civilians in Mali refer to the non-combatant population of the country.\nHistorical background: The civilian population in Mali has been caught in the crossfire between the Malian military, international peacekeeping forces, and armed groups since the 2012 Tuareg rebellion. Civilians have been targeted by all sides in the conflict, and human rights organizations have documented numerous cases of extrajudicial killings, abductions, and sexual violence.\nEconomic\/societal considerations: The conflict has led to the displacement of thousands of civilians, many of whom have been forced to flee their homes and seek refuge in other parts of the country or in neighboring countries.\n\nRank: 2nd\n\nRelationship between terms:\nThe question asks whether an armed group from Mali will engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in Mali between 1 October 2017 and 30 September 2018. The relationship between the terms is that the armed group is the actor that will either carry out or not carry out the action of systematically killing civilians.\n\nWhy one term might impact another:\nIf an armed group from Mali does engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in Mali, it will have a devastating impact on the civilian population and exacerbate the humanitarian crisis in the country. It will also likely lead to increased instability and violence in the region."},{"example_question":"Between 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019, will an armed group from South Sudan engage in a campaign

Mali?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0,"example_context":"Entities:\n1. Armed group from Mali\n2. Civilians in Mali\n\nArmed group from Mali:\nDefinition: An armed group in Mali refers to non-state actors who use violence to achieve their political objectives. These groups have emerged in Mali since the early 2000s, and their activities have escalated since the 2012 Tuareg rebellion and the subsequent French-led military intervention in 2013.\nHistorical background: The most prominent armed groups in Mali are the Islamist groups, such as Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), Ansar Dine, and the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa (MUJAO). These groups have been responsible for a series of attacks on Malian military and civilian targets, as well as on international peacekeeping forces in the country.\nEconomic\/societal considerations: The presence of armed groups in Mali has had a significant impact on the country's economy, particularly in the north, where the groups control smuggling routes and engage in other illegal activities.\n\nRank: 1st\n\nCivilians in Mali:\nDefinition: Civilians in Mali refer to the non-combatant population of the country.\nHistorical background: The civilian population in Mali has been caught in the crossfire between the Malian military, international peacekeeping forces, and armed groups since the 2012 Tuareg rebellion. Civilians have been targeted by all sides in the conflict, and human rights organizations have documented numerous cases of extrajudicial killings, abductions, and sexual violence.\nEconomic\/societal considerations: The conflict has led to the displacement of thousands of civilians, many of whom have been forced to flee their homes and seek refuge in other parts of the country or in neighboring countries.\n\nRank: 2nd\n\nRelationship between terms:\nThe question asks whether an armed group from Mali will engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in Mali between 1 October 2017 and 30 September 2018. The relationship between the terms is that the armed group is the actor that will either carry out or not carry out the action of systematically killing civilians.\n\nWhy one term might impact another:\nIf an armed group from Mali does engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in Mali, it will have a devastating impact on the civilian population and exacerbate the humanitarian crisis in the country. It will also likely lead to increased instability and violence in the region."},"lowest_uncertainty":0.0,"highest_uncertainty":0.5,"average_uncertainty":0.048,"external_context":"Afghanistan has been facing a severe humanitarian crisis due to the ongoing conflict and the COVID-19 pandemic. The UN has warned that more than 18 million people in Afghanistan are in need of humanitarian assistance, and the situation is likely to worsen in the coming months. The country is currently facing a severe drought, which has affected millions of people and their livelihoods. The UN has already declared a Level 3 emergency in Afghanistan, which is the highest level of humanitarian crisis. Therefore, it is possible that the UN may declare a famine in any part of Afghanistan in 2022."}

NATO: The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is a military alliance formed in 1949 between North American and European countries for collective defense against external threats. It currently has 30 member countries.\n- Candidate countries: These are countries that have expressed interest in joining NATO and have been invited to begin the accession process. As of 2021, there are four official candidate countries: North Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, and Ukraine. There are also several potential candidate countries, including Kosovo and Serbia.\n\nDates:\n- 4 February 2022: This is the starting point of the timeframe specified in the question.\n- 31 December 2022: This is the endpoint of the timeframe specified in the question.\n\nImportance ranking:\n- NATO: High importance, as the question specifically relates to NATO and its accession process.\n- Candidate countries: High importance, as these are the countries that are potentially involved in the accession process.\n- Dates: Medium importance, as they are specific to the timeframe of the question.\n\nBackground:\nNATO accession is a multi-step process that can take several years to complete. The process typically involves a series of reforms and adjustments made by the candidate country to meet NATO's political, military, and economic standards. Once a candidate country has completed these steps, it can be invited to join NATO, at which point it becomes a full member of the alliance.\n\nThe four official candidate countries have been working towards NATO membership for several years. North Macedonia signed an accession protocol in 2019 and became an official member in 2020. Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, and Ukraine are still in the earlier stages of the process.\n\nThere are several economic and societal considerations that may impact a country's ability to progress in the accession process. For example, candidate countries may need to make significant investments in their military infrastructure or improve their democratic institutions and rule of law. The political climate in both the candidate country and existing NATO member countries can also play a role in the process.\n\nRelationships:\nThe question asks whether a country will formally progress in the NATO accession process during a specific timeframe. This suggests that there may be ongoing negotiations or discussions between NATO and one or more candidate countries. The outcome of these negotiations could impact the future relationship between the candidate country and NATO, as well as the broader geopolitical landscape in Europe and beyond.","examples":[{"example_question":"Between 1 July 2017 and 30 June 2018, will an armed group from the Central African Republic engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in the Central African Republic?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Between 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2018, will an armed group from Turkey engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in Turkey?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Before 1 September 2021, will Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan sign an agreement governing the filling of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) reservoir?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will a member of the National League for Democracy (NLD) take office as president of Myanmar before April 2016?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) maintain its majority in Venezuela's National Assembly after the next legislative elections?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"In its 2022 report, will the Board of Trustees for Medicare project the year of asset depletion of the Hospital Insurance trust fund (\"HI,\" aka Medicare Part A) to be 2025 or before?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.35},{"example_question":"Before 1 January 2021, will a date be set for a referendum on Scotland's status within the United Kingdom?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.2},{"example_question":"Before the end of 2016, will a North American country, the EU, or an EU member state impose sanctions on another country in response to a cyber attack or cyber espionage?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Before 1 September 2022, will the World Trade Organization (WTO) officially agree to grant waivers for intellectual property protections for COVID-19 vaccine technology?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Between 1 July 2017 and 30 June 2018, will an armed group from Zimbabwe engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in Zimbabwe?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will Brazil's President Dilma Rousseff resign or be impeached before 1 April 2016?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Before 1 February 2020, will Ukraine adopt a new law giving or extending Donbas special status for local self-government?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.35},{"example_question":"Between 1 April 2019 and 31 March 2020, will an armed group from Sudan engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in Sudan?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the \"comfort women\" statue be removed from outside the Japanese Consulate in Busan before 1 January 2018?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the New START treaty be extended by Russia and the U.S. before 6 February 2021?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0,"example_context":"New START Treaty: \n\nDefinition: The New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) is a nuclear arms reduction treaty between the United States and Russia that was signed in April 2010.

Russia - A sovereign country located in Eastern Europe and Northern Asia. It is the largest country in the world by area.\n2. Transnistria - Also known as Pridnestrovskaia Moldavskaia Republic (PMR), it is a self-proclaimed republic in Eastern Europe. It is located in the eastern part of Moldova, bordering Ukraine.\n3. Moldova - A landlocked country in Eastern Europe, bordered by Romania to the west and Ukraine to the north, east, and south.\n\nDates:\n1. 1 August 2022 - The deadline for Russia to officially recognize Transnistria as an independent state.\n\nBackground:\n1. Transnistria - Transnistria declared independence from Moldova in 1990, following the collapse of the Soviet Union. It is mainly populated by ethnic Russians and Ukrainians, who make up the majority of the population. The region has its own government, constitution, military, and currency, but it is not recognized as an independent state by any country in the world.\n2. Moldova - Moldova gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. It is one of the poorest countries in Europe and has been politically unstable since its independence. The country has been trying to integrate with the European Union and NATO, but it faces opposition from Russia, which sees Moldova as part of its sphere of influence.\n3. Russia - Russia has been supporting Transnistria since its independence. It has a military presence in the region and provides economic aid to the separatist government. Russia sees Transnistria as a buffer zone between itself and NATO.\n\nEconomic and societal considerations:\n1. Transnistria - The region is heavily dependent on Russia for economic support. The separatist government has been accused of running a black market economy and engaging in smuggling activities.\n2. Moldova - Moldova is one of the poorest countries in Europe, with a GDP per capita of around $2,000. The country has been struggling with corruption, political instability, and emigration.\n3. Russia - Russia is a major player in the region and has been using its influence to maintain its sphere of influence in Eastern Europe. The country has been facing economic sanctions from the West, which has affected its economy.\n\nRelationship between the terms:\nRussia's recognition of Transnistria as an independent state would have a significant impact on the relationship between Russia, Moldova, and the West. It would be seen as a further expansion of Russia's influence in Eastern Europe and a challenge to Moldova's sovereignty. The recognition of Transnistria could also have economic and political implications for the region.\n\nRank of importance:\n1. Transnistria - The question is mainly focused on whether Russia will recognize Transnistria as an independent state, so it is the most important entity in this context.\n2. Russia - Russia's actions will determine the outcome of the question, so it is the second most important entity.\n3. Moldova - Moldova's sovereignty is at stake, but it is not the main focus of the question, so it is the least important entity.","examples":[{"example_question":"Before 1 January 2022, will the European Commission (EC) recommend that the Council of the European Union authorize the EC to open negotiations with Taiwan on an investment agreement?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Between 1 October 2018 and 30 September 2019, will an armed group from the Philippines engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in the Philippines?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Between 1 October 2018 and 30 September 2019, will an armed group from the Central African Republic engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in the Central African Republic?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0,"example_context":"Entities:\n1.

Vladimir Putin: The current President of the Russian Federation, in office since 2012.\n- Russian Federation: A sovereign state located in Eastern Europe and Northern Asia, formed in 1991 after the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nDates:\n- 1 January 2023: The date specified in the question as the deadline for Putin to cease being president.\n\nTerms:\n- Cease: To bring or come to an end; to stop.\n- President: The head of state of a republic.\n- Sovereign state: A political entity with a defined territory, a permanent population, and a government that has the power to make and enforce laws.\n- Soviet Union: A federal socialist state that existed from 1922 to 1991, consisting of 15 republics.\n- Eastern Europe: The region of Europe that is located to the east of Germany, Austria, and Italy.\n- Northern Asia: The northern part of Asia, which includes Russia, Kazakhstan, and Mongolia.\n\nHistorical background:\n- Putin was first elected president in 2000, and was re-elected in 2004. He was then appointed as Prime Minister by his successor, Dmitry Medvedev, and served in that role from 2008 to 2012. Putin was then re-elected as president in 2012 and 2018.\n- The Russian Federation was formed in 1991, following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Since then, it has undergone significant political and economic changes, including the adoption of a new constitution in 1993 and the transition to a market-based economy.\n- The Soviet Union was a socialist state that was formed in 1922, following the Russian Revolution of 1917. It was a global superpower during much of the 20th century, but collapsed in 1991 due to a combination of economic, political, and social factors.\n\nEconomic and societal considerations:\n- Putin's presidency has been marked by both economic growth and political controversy. During his time in office, Russia has experienced significant economic expansion, particularly in the energy sector. However, Putin has also been accused of suppressing political opposition and limiting freedom of the press.\n- The question of Putin's continued presidency is likely to have significant implications for Russia's political and economic future. Putin has been a dominant figure in Russian politics for many years, and his departure from the presidency could lead to significant changes in the country's leadership and policies.\n\nRelationships between terms:\n- Putin's presidency is closely tied to the history and politics of the Russian Federation, which was formed after the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n- The Soviet Union, which preceded the Russian Federation, was a socialist state that had a significant impact on the politics and economy of the region.\n- The question of whether Putin will remain president is likely to have significant implications for the future of the Russian Federation, particularly in terms of its political and economic stability.\n\nRanking of terms:\n1.

Russia: A country located in Eastern Europe and Northern Asia, known for its political, economic, and military power.\n- Nuclear device: A weapon that derives its destructive force from nuclear reactions, either through fission (splitting atoms) or fusion (merging atoms).\n- Territory: A geographical area that is controlled by a particular country or government.\n- Airspace: The area above a country's territory that is subject to its jurisdiction and control.\n\nDates:\n- Before 5 August 2022: The specific timeframe for the question.\n\nDefinitions:\n- Nuclear device: The term \"nuclear device\" refers to any weapon that uses nuclear reactions to create an explosion. This can include both fission and fusion weapons, as well as improvised devices such as dirty bombs.\n- Territory: A geographical area that is controlled by a particular country or government. This can include land, water, and airspace.\n- Airspace: The area above a country's territory that is subject to its jurisdiction and control. This can include both civilian and military airspace.\n\nHistorical background:\n- Russia's nuclear program: Russia has a long history of nuclear weapons development, dating back to the Soviet era. Today, Russia is one of the world's largest nuclear powers, with an estimated 6,255 nuclear warheads in its arsenal.\n- Nuclear testing: Russia has conducted numerous nuclear tests over the years, both above and below ground. The last known test was conducted in 2017, when Russia tested a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile.\n- Nuclear proliferation: The spread of nuclear weapons is a major concern in international relations, and Russia has been accused of aiding other countries in their nuclear programs, such as Iran and North Korea.\n\nImportant economic and societal considerations:\n- Nuclear weapons have a significant impact on global politics and security. The use of a nuclear device outside of Russian territory or airspace would likely have severe consequences for international relations and could potentially lead to war.\n- The deployment and maintenance of nuclear weapons is also a major expense for Russia, and the country's economic situation could impact its decision to use or not use nuclear weapons.\n\nRelationships between terms:\n- The question asks whether Russia will detonate a nuclear device outside of its own territory or airspace. This suggests that the detonation would be an intentional act of aggression, rather than an accident or malfunction.\n- The question does not specify the reason for the detonation or the target, so it is unclear what the motivation for such an action would be.\n- The question is focused specifically on Russia's actions, rather than the actions of other countries.\n\nRank of importance:\n1. Nuclear device: The main subject of the question and the potential cause of significant harm.\n2. Russia: The country whose actions are being questioned.\n3. Territory: The location where the detonation would occur.\n4. Airspace: The area where the detonation would occur, and which is subject to Russian control.","examples":[{"example_question":"Before 1 January 2022, will the European Commission (EC) recommend that

NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization): An intergovernmental military alliance established in 1949, composed of 30 member countries from North America and Europe.\n- Russian government: The executive branch of the government of the Russian Federation, headed by the President of Russia.\n- Member state: A country that is a member of NATO, currently consisting of Albania, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Montenegro, Netherlands, North Macedonia, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Turkey, United Kingdom, and United States.\n\nDates:\n- 4 March 2022: The starting date of the specified time frame.\n- 4 September 2022: The ending date of the specified time frame.\n\nSpecial terms:\n- Lethal cyberattack: An attack that results in the death of one or more individuals, caused by a cyber-related incident.\n- Five fatalities: The minimum number of deaths required for the scenario to be considered true.\n\nHistorical background:\n- NATO-Russia relations: The relationship between NATO and Russia has been complicated since the end of the Cold War. NATO has expanded its membership and conducted military exercises near Russia's borders, while Russia has annexed Crimea and supported separatist movements in Eastern Ukraine. The two sides have also accused each other of cyberattacks and interference in domestic politics.\n- Cyberattacks: The use of computer networks to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems, often for political or financial gain. Cyberattacks have become more common and sophisticated in recent years, targeting governments, businesses, and individuals.\n- Attribution problem: It can be difficult to attribute cyberattacks to specific actors, as the attackers can use various techniques to hide their identity and location. This can lead to disputes and uncertainty about who is responsible for an attack.\n\nEconomic and societal considerations:\n- Cybersecurity: The protection of computer systems and networks from unauthorized access, theft, and damage. Cybersecurity is increasingly important for governments, businesses, and individuals, as cyber threats can cause significant economic and societal harm.\n- International law: The rules and principles governing relations between states, including in the areas of war, peace, and security. The use of cyberattacks by states raises questions about the applicability and adequacy of existing international law in this field.\n\nRelationship between terms:\n- The question asks about a possible future scenario where a NATO member state accuses Russia of conducting a lethal cyberattack resulting in at least five fatalities. This scenario would likely have significant implications for NATO-Russia relations, cybersecurity, and international law.\n- The scenario would also raise questions about the attribution problem and the difficulty of proving responsibility for cyberattacks.\n\nRank of importance:\n1.

NATO: The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is a political and military alliance between North American and European countries established in 1949. The organization aims to ensure the collective defense of its members in case of an attack by an external party.\n- Member states: There are currently 30 member states in NATO, including the United States, Canada, and various European countries.\n\nDates:\n- 2023: The year in which the question is asking about.\n\nTerms:\n- GDP: Gross Domestic Product is the total value of goods and services produced by a country in a specific period.\n- Defense spending: The amount of money a country spends on its military, including personnel, equipment, research and development, and operations.\n\nHistorical background:\n- The 2.0% defense spending target: In 2014, NATO member states agreed to aim to spend 2.0% of their GDP on defense by 2024. This target was set in response to concerns about increasing security threats, including Russian aggression, and a perceived lack of burden-sharing among NATO members. As of 2021, only 10 member states have met the 2.0% target.\n- NATO's role in defense spending: NATO does not have direct control over the defense spending of its member states. However, it encourages members to increase their defense spending and provides a forum for coordination and cooperation on defense matters.\n\nSocietal and economic considerations:\n- Defense spending can have significant societal and economic impacts. It can contribute to job creation and economic growth in the defense industry, but it can also divert resources away from other areas such as healthcare, education, and social welfare programs.\n- The 2.0% defense spending target has been a contentious issue among NATO members. Some countries, particularly those in Europe, have argued that other areas such as development and diplomacy should also be considered as part of a broader approach to security. Others, including the United States, have pushed for a strict adherence to the 2.0% target.\n\nRelationship between terms:\n- The question is asking how many NATO member states will meet the 2.0% defense spending target in 2023. This target was set by NATO in 2014, but it is up to individual member states to decide how much they will spend on defense.\n- The question implies a relationship between defense spending and membership in NATO. However, not all countries that spend 2.0% or more of their GDP on defense are members of NATO, and not all NATO members spend 2.0% or more of their GDP on defense.\n\nRank of importance:\n1. GDP\n2.

Russia: A country located in Eastern Europe and Northern Asia. It is the world's largest country by land area, and its economy is heavily reliant on oil and gas exports.\n- GDP: Gross Domestic Product, which measures the total value of goods and services produced by a country in a given time period.\n- IMF: International Monetary Fund, an international organization that promotes global monetary cooperation and provides financial assistance to member countries.\n\nDates:\n- 2021: The current year.\n- 2022: The year for which the percentage change in Russia's GDP is being predicted.\n\nRanking:\n- Russia: 4\/5\n- GDP: 5\/5\n- IMF: 3\/5\n- 2021: 2\/5\n- 2022: 2\/5\n\nBackground:\nRussia's economy has been heavily impacted by fluctuations in oil prices and international sanctions. In 2020, its GDP contracted by 3.1% due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a drop in oil prices. The IMF predicts that Russia's economy will recover in 2021, with a projected GDP growth rate of 3.8%. However, this growth rate is dependent on the continued recovery from the pandemic and stability in oil prices.\n\nThe IMF has not yet released a prediction for the percentage change in Russia's GDP in 2022. However, their current projections for global economic growth in 2022 are optimistic, with a predicted growth rate of 4.9%. If this growth is sustained and oil prices remain stable, it is possible that Russia's economy could continue to recover in 2022.\n\nIt is important to note that Russia's economy is also impacted by political factors, such as the country's relationship with other nations and the actions of its government. Sanctions imposed by other countries, for example, can have a significant impact on Russia's economy.\n\nOverall, the percentage change in Russia's GDP in 2022 relative to its GDP in 2021 is an important economic indicator for Russia and the global economy. However, it is dependent on a variety of factors, including the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, stability in oil prices, and political stability.","examples":[{"example_question":"How many earthquakes of magnitude 5 or stronger will occur worldwide between 1 December 2017 and 15 December 2017?","example_choices":["Less than 57","Between 57 and 64, inclusive","More than 64 but less than 71","Between 71 and 78, inclusive","More than 78"],"example_answer":"A","majority_predicted_answer":"F","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will Congress pass a resolution disapproving the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action?","example_choices":["No","Yes, but the resolution will be vetoed by the President and the veto will stand","Yes, and the resolution will become law"],"example_answer":"A","majority_predicted_answer":"F","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"How many total civilian deaths for December 2017 will the Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR) report?","example_choices":["Less than 800","Between 800 to 900, inclusive","More than 900 but less than 950","Between 950 to 1,000, inclusive","More than 1,000"],"example_answer":"A","majority_predicted_answer":"F","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"What will happen to the European Union's sectoral sanctions against Russia, currently set to expire in July 2016?","example_choices":["The sanctions will be extended","Some of the sanctions will be extended, but others will be relaxed or allowed to expire","The sanctions will expire"],"example_answer":"A","majority_predicted_answer":"F","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"At close of business on 27 January 2021, will the upper limit of the Federal Reserve's target range for the federal funds rate be lower, the same, or higher than it was at close of business on 16 December 2020?","example_choices":["Lower","Same","Higher"],"example_answer":"B","majority_predicted_answer":"F","uncertainty":0.0,"example_context":"Entities:\n- Federal Reserve: The central banking system of the United States, responsible for conducting monetary policy and regulating the banking system.\n\nDates:\n- 27 January 2021: The date in question for the upper limit of the Federal Reserve's target range for the federal funds rate.\n- 16 December 2020: The date used as a comparison for the upper limit of the Federal Reserve's target range for the federal funds rate.\n\nSpecial terms:\n- Federal funds rate: The interest rate at which depository institutions lend balances to each other overnight, set by the Federal Reserve.\n- Target range: The range of the federal funds rate that the Federal Reserve aims to maintain through its monetary policy.\n\nHistorical background:\n- The Federal Reserve was established in 1913 to provide stability to the banking system and promote economic growth.\n- The federal funds rate has been a key tool of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy since the 1920s.\n- The target range for the federal funds rate was introduced in 2008 as a way for the Federal Reserve to more effectively communicate its monetary policy stance to the public.\n\nEconomic and societal considerations:\n- The federal funds rate can impact a wide range of economic variables, including inflation, employment, and consumer spending.\n- Changes in the federal funds rate can have ripple effects throughout the financial system, affecting everything from mortgage rates to stock prices.\n- The Federal Reserve's decisions on monetary policy can be influenced by a variety of factors, including economic indicators, political considerations, and global events.\n\nRelationship between terms:\n- The federal funds rate and the target range are closely related, as the target range represents the range of the federal funds rate that the Federal Reserve is seeking to maintain.\n- Changes in the federal funds rate can impact the target range, as the Federal Reserve may adjust the target range in response to changes in economic conditions.\n- The Federal Reserve's decisions on monetary policy, including changes to the federal funds rate and the target range, can have significant impacts on the economy and society.\n\nRanking of importance:\n1.

Nuclear weapons - Explosive devices that derive their destructive force from nuclear reactions.\n2. Publicly announce - To make an official statement about something, often to the media or the public.\n3. Move - To change the location of something from one place to another.\n\nHistorical background:\nRussia is one of the world's nine nuclear-armed states, and it maintains a significant nuclear arsenal. Belarus and Ukraine are former Soviet republics that inherited nuclear weapons after the collapse of the Soviet Union, but they both agreed to give up their nuclear weapons and join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in the 1990s. However, tensions between Russia and these countries have been high in recent years due to territorial disputes, political differences, and economic sanctions.\n\nEconomic and societal considerations:\nThe movement of nuclear weapons into Belarus or Ukraine would have significant economic and societal consequences. It could escalate tensions in the region and potentially lead to military conflict. It could also impact international relations and lead to economic sanctions or other diplomatic measures.\n\nRelationship between terms:\nThe question asks whether Russia will publicly announce that it has moved nuclear weapons into either Belarus or Ukraine during a specific time period. This implies that Russia may already have nuclear weapons in these countries or may be planning to move them. The question also suggests that the movement of nuclear weapons would be a significant event with potential implications for international relations and regional security.\n\nRank of importance:\n1.

The conflict has resulted in thousands of deaths and has led to economic sanctions against Russia by the West.\n\nImportant economic or societal considerations:\n- A NATO member state accusing Russia of using a chemical or biological weapon in Ukraine could lead to increased tensions between Russia and NATO member states, potentially leading to economic sanctions or even military action.\n- The ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine has already had significant economic and societal impacts, including displacement of civilians, damage to infrastructure, and loss of life.\n\nRelationships:\n- The ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine is a major source of tension between Russia and NATO member states.\n- Accusations of Russia using a chemical or biological weapon in Ukraine would likely escalate tensions even further and could lead to significant economic and societal impacts.\n\nRanking:\n1. Ukraine - The location of the potential event and a major source of tension between Russia and NATO member states.\n2. Russia - The accused party in the potential event and a major player in the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine.\n3. NATO - The organization to which the potential accusing member state belongs and a key player in the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine.\n4. Chemical or biological weapon - The potential means by which Russia could be accused of perpetrating an attack.\n5. 5 August 2022 - The deadline for the potential event.","examples":[{"example_question":"Before 1 January 2020, will any EU member state besides the UK set a date for a referendum on leaving the EU or the eurozone?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Between 1 October 2017 and 30 September 2018, will an armed group from Myanmar engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in Myanmar?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.5},{"example_question":"Between 1 July 2018 and 30 June 2019, will an armed group from the Philippines engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in the Philippines?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will an unmanned aerial vehicle be used by a non-governmental or intra-governmental organization to deliver humanitarian aid to a conflict zone in 2017?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.4},{"example_question":"Between 1 April 2019 and 31 March 2020, will an armed group from Yemen engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in Yemen?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.25},{"example_question":"Between 1 October 2017 and 30 September 2018, will an armed group from Iraq engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in Iraq?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.4},{"example_question":"Before 15 November 2019, will there be a lethal confrontation between the national military forces of Iran and Saudi Arabia either in Iran or at sea?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.35},{"example_question":"Will China begin land reclamation activity at Scarborough Shoal or in the Macclesfield Bank before 1 October 2017?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.25},{"example_question":"Before 22 July 2021, will Hamas or the Israeli government accuse the other of violating the Gaza ceasefire agreed to on 20 May 2021?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will any 2020 California election results be altered by a cyberattack against a voting system?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.15},{"example_question":"Will there be a new episode of mass killing in Turkey before 1 January 2017?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.45},{"example_question":"Between 1 January 2019 and 31 December 2019, will an armed group from Afghanistan engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in Afghanistan?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.45},{"example_question":"Before 1 October 2018, will either Russia or the United States announce that it is suspending its participation in or withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.25},{"example_question":"Will Facebook add warning labels to news stories before July 2017?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Before 2018, will there be a lethal attack on a US military vessel in the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, Persian Gulf, or Gulf of Oman?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0,"example_context":"Entities:\n- US Military Vessel: A naval ship operated by the United States Armed Forces.

{"question":"Between 8 April 2022 and 8 October 2022, will NATO or a NATO member state publicly accuse the People's Republic of China of having provided lethal aid to Russia after 24 February 2022 for use in Ukraine?","id":"G2344","background":"As the war in Ukraine continues, the US and others have voiced concerns over China possibly providing support for Russia's war effort (BBC, ABC News). For the purposes of this question, \"lethal aid\" means any weapon, ammunition, or other equipment or material that is designed to inflict serious bodily injury or death (Cornell - 10 USC \u00a72557, effectively the inverse of 10 USC \u00a72557(d)(1)(B)). Examples of lethal aid include bullets, warplanes, missiles, and armed drones, but would not include surveillance equipment, body armor, medical supplies, intelligence, etc. An accusation need not explicitly characterize aid as \"lethal aid\" to count so long as the accusation includes enough detail to ascertain that the aid given was lethal, but the accusation must assert that the lethal aid was provided for use by Russia in Ukraine. Recent examples of an accusation of lethal aid being provided include Russia and China arming the military junta in Myanmar and Turkey providing armed drones to Ethiopia (Deutsche Welle, US News &amp; World Report).","publish_time":1649429728327,"close_time":"2022-10-08 07:01:00+00:00","tags":["Foreign Policy","Security and

which the question asks if China provided lethal aid to Russia for use in Ukraine.\n\nTerms:\n- Lethal aid: Military equipment or weapons that are intended to cause death or serious injury to people.\n- Accuse: To claim that someone has done something wrong or illegal, often with evidence or proof.\n- Publicly: In a way that is open and known to the public.\n\nHistorical background:\n- NATO was formed in 1949 as a response to the perceived threat of Soviet expansionism in Europe during the Cold War.\n- China and Russia share a border and have a long history of diplomatic and economic ties. In recent years, they have increased their cooperation in areas such as energy and defense.\n- The conflict between Ukraine and Russia began in 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea and has since escalated into a full-scale war in the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine. The conflict has resulted in thousands of deaths and displacement of people.\n\nEconomic and societal considerations:\n- Accusing China of providing lethal aid to Russia could have diplomatic and economic consequences, as China is a major trading partner for many NATO member states.\n- The conflict in Ukraine has already had economic and humanitarian consequences for the region and could be further exacerbated by any escalation in the conflict.\n\nRelationship between the terms:\n- The question asks whether NATO or a NATO member state will publicly accuse China of providing lethal aid to Russia after a specific date in 2022. This implies that there is some suspicion or evidence that China has provided such aid to Russia, and that NATO or a member state may choose to make this accusation publicly.\n- The question also specifies that the aid is intended for use in Ukraine, indicating that the conflict in Ukraine is a key factor in this question.\n\nRanking of importance:\n1.

Palladium: a chemical element with the symbol Pd and atomic number 46. It is a rare and lustrous silvery-white metal that is used in catalytic converters, jewelry, and electronics.\n- London Metal Exchange (LME): a commodity exchange that deals in metals such as copper, aluminum, and nickel, among others.\n\nDates:\n- 21 October 2022: the date in question, when the price of palladium is being asked.\n\nRanking:\n- Palladium: extremely important, as it is the focus of the question.\n- London Metal Exchange: very important, as it is the source of the price information being asked for.\n- 21 October 2022: important, as it is the date in question.\n\nHistorical background:\n- Palladium was discovered in 1803 by William Hyde Wollaston, and named after the asteroid Pallas.\n- It has a number of unique properties that make it useful in various applications, such as its ability to absorb hydrogen and its resistance to corrosion.\n- The price of palladium has been volatile in recent years, with a significant increase in price from around $500 per ounce in early 2016 to over $2,000 per ounce in early 2020, before dropping back down to around $1,000 per ounce in mid-2021.\n- The London Metal Exchange was founded in 1877 and is one of the world's oldest and largest metal exchanges.\n\nEconomic and societal considerations:\n- The price of palladium is influenced by a number of factors, such as supply and demand, economic growth, geopolitical tensions, and environmental regulations.\n- The automotive industry is a major consumer of palladium, as it is used in catalytic converters to reduce emissions. Therefore, changes in the demand for vehicles, as well as changes in emissions regulations, can impact the price of palladium.\n- The COVID-19 pandemic has also had an impact on the price of palladium, with disruptions to mining and supply chains leading to increased volatility.\n\nRelationship between terms:\n- The London Metal Exchange provides a platform for trading metals, including palladium, and therefore plays a crucial role in determining the price of palladium.\n- The date in question, 21 October 2022, is important as it is the specific date for which the price of palladium is being asked.\n- The historical background and economic and societal considerations provide context for understanding the factors that have influenced the price of palladium in the past and may continue to do so in the future.","examples":[{"example_question":"When will Nasser Zefzafi be released from prison?","example_choices":["Before 1 October 2017","Between 1 October 2017 and 31 December

US Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR): a federally-owned oil stockpile created in 1975 to mitigate the impact of oil supply disruptions and serve as a national security measure.\n- Crude oil: a type of petroleum that has not been processed or refined yet.\n\nDates:\n- December 2022: the specific month and year when the question asks about the ending stocks of crude oil in the SPR.\n\nRanking of importance:\n- US Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR): very important, as it is the main entity being asked about in the question.\n- Crude oil: important, as it is the type of oil being stored in the SPR.\n\nHistorical background:\n- The US established the SPR after the 1973-1974 oil embargo to prevent future oil supply disruptions.\n- The SPR has a current maximum capacity of 714 million barrels of crude oil.\n- The SPR has been used only three times: in 1991 during the Gulf War, in 2005 after Hurricane Katrina, and in 2011 during the conflict in Libya.\n\nEconomic and societal considerations:\n- The SPR can affect global oil prices, as releasing oil from the reserve can increase supply and decrease prices, while filling up the SPR can decrease supply and increase prices.\n- The SPR can also impact domestic energy security, as the oil can be used to alleviate shortages and maintain critical infrastructure during times of crisis.\n- The SPR can be costly to maintain and fill up, and there have been debates over its usefulness and whether it should be expanded or reduced.\n\nRelationship between terms:\n- The ending stocks of crude oil in the SPR in December 2022 will depend on various factors, such as oil demand, supply disruptions, and geopolitical events.\n- The ending stocks in the SPR can impact global oil prices, domestic energy security, and government spending on the SPR.\n\nOverall, the question is highly specific and depends on various unpredictable factors, but it is relevant to ongoing debates over the usefulness and future of the SPR.","examples":[{"example_question":"When will the yield curve for 2-year and 10-year US Treasury bonds next invert?","example_choices":["Before 23 April 2022","Between 23 April 2022 and 20 May

North Korea: A country located in East Asia, known for its secretive and isolated regime, and its nuclear weapons program.\n- Nuclear device: A general term that refers to any weapon that uses nuclear reactions as its explosive force.\n\nDates:\n- 29 April 2022: The starting date for the time period in question.\n- 30 November 2022: The ending date for the time period in question.\n\nRanking:\n- North Korea: Very important, as it is the country in question.\n- Nuclear device: Extremely important, as it is the specific action being asked about.\n- Dates: Important, as they define the time period in question.\n\nBackground:\n- North Korea's nuclear weapons program has been a source of international concern for several decades. The country conducted its first nuclear test in 2006 and has since conducted several more, in defiance of international sanctions and pressure.\n- The United States and other countries have attempted to negotiate with North Korea in order to halt or roll back its nuclear program, with limited success. In recent years, there have been a number of high-profile diplomatic efforts, including meetings between North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump, but these have not resulted in a significant change in North Korea's behavior.\n- North Korea has a history of using provocative actions, such as missile launches and nuclear tests, to try to gain leverage in negotiations or to send a message to the international community.\n- The period in question, from late April to late November 2022, is relatively short, but it is possible that North Korea could conduct a nuclear test during this time. It is also possible that the country could choose to refrain from such a test, either because of internal considerations or in response to diplomatic pressure.\n\nRelationships:\n- The relationship between North Korea and the international community, particularly the United States, is an important factor in understanding the likelihood of a nuclear test. If tensions between North Korea and the US increase, for example, this could increase the chances of a test.\n- The relationship between North Korea's domestic politics and its nuclear program is also important. Kim Jong-un has used the nuclear program as a way to bolster his own legitimacy and to project strength both domestically and internationally. If Kim feels that his regime is under threat, he may be more likely to order a nuclear test.\n- The relationship between North Korea's nuclear program and its economic situation is also relevant. North Korea is heavily sanctioned by the international community, and its economy is in a precarious state. If the regime feels that a nuclear test would help it to gain leverage in negotiations over sanctions relief or other economic aid, it may be more likely to conduct one.","examples":[{"example_question":"Will the Trans-Pacific Partnership be ratified by Congress before 20 January 2017?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"I","uncertainty":0.45},{"example_question":"Will legislation enabling the creation of federal safety standards for autonomous vehicles (AVs) become law before 1 January 2021?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Before 1 October 2018, will Kim Jong-un cease to be supreme leader of North Korea?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"I","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Before 30 April 2017, will the U.S. suspend immigration from any country designated as a state sponsor of terrorism or a terrorist safe haven?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.5},{"example_question":"Between 1 October 2018 and 30 September 2019, will an armed group from the Democratic Republic of Congo engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in the Democratic Republic of Congo?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"I","uncertainty":0.3},{"example_question":"Will Bashar al-Assad cease to be president of Syria before 1 January 2020?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Between 9 November 2020 and 28 February 2021, will a country cease to formally recognize Taiwan?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.25},{"example_question":"Will there be an act of domestic terrorism in the United States resulting in 10 or more fatalities before 1 January 2022?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will al-Shabaab attack a US diplomatic facility in Africa before 1 July 2018?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.1},{"example_question":"Will Poland reinstate visa-free travel for Kaliningrad before 2018?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Between 1 July 2017 and 30 June 2018, will an armed group from Pakistan engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in Pakistan?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.3},{"example_question":"Between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018, will an armed group from Nigeria engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in Nigeria?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"I","uncertainty":0.4},{"example_question":"Before 1 January 2022, will the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and\/or People's Armed Police (PAP) engage in a confrontation with Hong Kongers?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Between 1 October 2018 and 30 September 2019, will an armed group from Pakistan engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in Pakistan?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0,"example_context":"Entities:\n- Armed group: This refers to a non-state actor that is armed and carries out violent activities.

{"question":"Between 29 April 2022 and 1 December 2022, will the United States launch either an ICBM or a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) with an estimated range of at least 10,000 km?","id":"G2372","background":"After the US delayed then canceled an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) test amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Russia subsequently tested a new ICBM of its own (US News &amp; World Report, Space.com). For the purposes of this question, the estimated range of a launched ICBM or SLBM will be determined using data and reporting provided by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), then open source reporting if needed (CSIS). If an estimate provided is a range (e.g., between 9,000km and 11,000km), the high end of the range will be used to determine if the launch qualifies. A missile will be deemed to have launched if there is credible reporting that the ICBM left the ground or SLBM cleared the water and its first stage ignited.","publish_time":1651246832626,"close_time":"2022-12-02 08:01:00+00:00","tags":["Technology","Foreign Policy","Security and Conflict","US

United States: a federal republic composed of 50 states, located primarily in North America, with Washington D.C. as its capital.\n- ICBM: Intercontinental Ballistic Missile, a missile with a minimum range of 5,500 km, designed for nuclear weapons delivery.\n- SLBM: Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missile, a missile launched from a submarine for nuclear weapons delivery.\n\nDates:\n- 29 April 2022: a specific date mentioned in the question.\n- 1 December 2022: a specific date mentioned in the question.\n\nRanking:\n- United States: 10\/10, as it is the main entity in the question.\n- ICBM and SLBM: 9\/10, as they are the two types of missiles mentioned in the question and are crucial to understanding the question.\n\nHistorical background:\nThe United States has a long history of developing and deploying nuclear weapons. The country was the first to develop nuclear weapons and used them in World War II. Since then, the U.S. has maintained a nuclear arsenal and has developed various delivery systems, including ICBMs and SLBMs. The U.S. currently has a total of 400 ICBMs and 240 SLBMs in its arsenal.\n\nBackground on important economic or societal considerations:\nThe development and deployment of nuclear weapons and their delivery systems have significant economic and societal implications. The cost of maintaining and upgrading the U.S. nuclear arsenal is estimated to be $1.2 trillion over the next 30 years. The use of nuclear weapons can have catastrophic consequences for human life and the environment, and the threat of nuclear war has been a major source of geopolitical tension.\n\nRelationship between the terms:\nThe question asks whether the United States will launch an ICBM or an SLBM with a range of at least 10,000 km within a specific time frame. ICBMs and SLBMs are both types of missiles designed for nuclear weapons delivery, and their use would have significant implications for global security.\n\nWhy one term might impact another:\nThe use of ICBMs or SLBMs with a range of at least 10,000 km would be a significant escalation of nuclear capabilities and could have serious implications for global security and stability. The development and deployment of these missiles are subject to international treaties and agreements, and their use could have diplomatic and political consequences.","examples":[{"example_question":"Will China officially declare an air-defense identification zone (ADIZ) over any part of the South China Sea before 1 August 2017?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"I","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the United States remove Iran from the list of countries identified as state sponsors of terrorism before 18 October 2016?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.4},{"example_question":"Between 15 September 2020 and 30 November 2020, will a country cease to formally recognize Taiwan?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Before 1 April 2018, will General Motors test an autonomous vehicle in New York City?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will any 2020 California election results be altered by a cyberattack against a voting system?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0,"example_context":"Entities:\n- California: California is a state located in the western United States, bordered by Oregon to the north, Nevada to the east, and Arizona to the southeast.\n- 2020 California election: This refers to the general election held in California on November 3, 2020, in which voters cast their ballots for various federal, state, and local officials, as well as on ballot propositions and measures.\n- Cyberattack: A cyberattack is an attempt to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to a computer system or network.\n\nBackground:\n- California has a history of election security concerns, including issues with outdated voting machines and allegations of voter suppression.

Famine is a severe shortage of food that results in widespread hunger and malnutrition. The United Nations (UN) is an international organization founded in 1945 to promote peace, security, and cooperation among countries. The UN has a specialized agency called the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) that monitors food security and nutrition around the world. In recent years, several countries in Western Africa have experienced food insecurity due to a combination of factors such as conflict, climate change, and economic instability. However, it is difficult to predict whether the UN will declare a famine in any part of an ECOWAS member state before 1 April 2023. The situation can change rapidly depending on various factors such as weather patterns, political stability, and humanitarian aid.

This indicates that the EU is concerned about the situation in Xinjiang and is taking action to address it.\n- The human rights violations and abuses in Xinjiang are the reason for the EU's potential imposition of restrictive measures on China. The Uighur Muslims are the group that is being targeted by these abuses.\n\nRank of Importance:\n1. Human Rights Violations and Abuses in Xinjiang\n2. Restrictive Measures\n3. Council of the European Union\n4. Uighur Muslims\n5.

{"question":"Will Tesla become the world's largest motor vehicle producer in some calendar year prior to 2035?","id":"M980","background":"While Tesla is already a very large automobile company based on market capitalisation, a lot of that market capitalisation is based on expectations of the future. As of the writing of this question, Tesla is losing money and selling significantly less cars than even the 20th largest auto-company in the world. Yet, the expectations that have been set for Tesla by Elon Musk would probably require Tesla to sell more cars than any other company on the planet while maintaining large profit-margins. In order to ramp-up production from approx. 100,000 to 500,000 or 1,000,000 cars a year, Tesla has created the Model 3, its first mass market car. Regrettably, Tesla has had trouble producing the Model 3 and production of the car can be tracked here. It is likely that Tesla's total vehicle production must exceed 10 million in order for it to become the world's largest car company. Yet, given its financial situation, there is a risk that the company goes bankrupt before that happens. So, without further ado, it is asked:Will Tesla become the world's largest motor vehicle producer in some calendar year prior to 2035? Data for resolution shall be taken from the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers, which is where the Wikipedia link got the data from itself.","publish_time":1529650800000,"close_time":"2024-12-31 23:00:00+00:00","tags":["Computing \u2013 Artificial Intelligence","Technology \u2013 Automotive","Industry \u2013

This means that the income ratio between the top and bottom 20% was 6.38, which is already higher than the 6.12414 threshold mentioned in the question. However, it is difficult to predict whether this specific measurement of household income inequality will increase by at least 20% before 01 January 2025.

{"question":"Will the USA's Labor Force Participation Rate be lower in 2023 than in 2018?","id":"M1663","background":"My thanks to Jgalt and Uncle Jeff for inspiring this question. The labor force participation rate (LFPR) is the ratio between the labor force and the overall size of their cohort. It is sometimes opposed to the unemployment rate, since it includes people who for various reasons are not in the job market. It hovered around 59% until the late 1960's, then grew as high as 67% in 2000 before shrinking back to 63% in recent years. It seems to be roughly stable since 2014. (graph and data here). Will the USA's Labor Force Participation Rate be lower in 2023 than in 2018? This question will resolve as Yes if the US' Labor Force Participation rate for the calendar year 2023 is lower than 2018, according to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, series ID LNS11300000. The quantities considered are the 12-month averages for 2018 and 2023. If the rates are the same (within 0.1 percentage points), this question will resolve as ambiguous. If BLS do not report data for the entire year 2023, this question wil resolve as ambiguous.","publish_time":1545433200000,"close_time":"2023-12-31 23:00:00+00:00","tags":["Economy \u2013

Labor Force Participation Rate (LFPR): The percentage of the population that is either employed or actively seeking employment.\n- USA: The United States of America.\n\nDates:\n- 2018: The most recent year for which data on LFPR is available.\n- 2023: The year in question for the prediction.\n\nImportance Ranking:\n- LFPR: 10\/10\n- USA: 9\/10\n- 2018: 7\/10\n- 2023: 7\/10\n\nBackground:\n- Labor Force Participation Rate: LFPR is an important economic indicator that measures the percentage of the working-age population who are actively participating in the labor market. It is calculated by dividing the number of people employed or actively seeking employment by the total population of working-age individuals.\n- USA: The United States of America is one of the largest and most influential economies in the world, with a population of approximately 328 million people. The US labor market is diverse and dynamic, with a wide range of industries and occupations.\n- 2018: The LFPR in the US was 62.7%, which was slightly higher than the 62.3% LFPR in 2015 but lower than the 66.4% LFPR in 2006.\n- 2023: This is the year in question for the prediction, and it is currently five years in the future. \n\nHistorical background:\n- The LFPR in the US has been on a long-term decline since the late 1990s, due in part to demographic changes such as an aging population and a decline in the number of women entering the labor force. The LFPR also declined sharply during the Great Recession of 2008-2009, and has only partially recovered since then.\n- The US labor market has been characterized by increasing income inequality, with many workers experiencing stagnant wages and limited job opportunities. This has led to political and social tensions, particularly in the context of the 2016 US presidential election.\n\nRelationship between terms:\n- LFPR is a key measure of the health of the US labor market, and is affected by a wide range of economic, social, and demographic factors. Changes in LFPR can have significant implications for economic growth, social welfare, and political stability.\n- The relationship between LFPR and other economic indicators such as GDP, inflation, and unemployment is complex and multifaceted. For example, a lower LFPR can lead to lower economic growth due to a smaller labor supply, but it can also lead to lower inflation due to lower wage pressures.\n\nSocietal and economic considerations:\n- The US labor market is influenced by a wide range of social and economic factors, including education, immigration policy, trade policy, and technological change. Changes in LFPR can have significant implications for these factors, as well as for issues such as income inequality, poverty, and social mobility.\n- The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the US labor market, leading to widespread job losses and a decline in LFPR. The long-term effects of the pandemic on the US labor market are uncertain, but are likely to be significant. \n\nOverall, the LFPR is a critical economic indicator that is closely watched by policymakers, economists, and the public.

The period after World War II, in particular, was marked by a sustained period of economic expansion, with real GDP growth rates exceeding 8% in several years. In 1950, the US recorded its highest annual real GDP growth rate of 8.7%. However, in recent decades, growth rates have been lower, with the highest annual growth rate since 1984 being 4.5% in 1999.\n\nSocietal considerations:\nHigh economic growth rates can have positive effects on society, such as creating jobs, increasing wages, and improving living standards. However, sustained high growth rates can also lead to inflation and asset bubbles, which can have negative effects on the economy and society as a whole.\n\nRelationships between terms:\nThe question is asking whether the US will exceed its historical record for annual real GDP growth rate before Q1 2030. This is based on the assumption that high growth rates are possible and desirable, but it is unclear what factors might drive such growth. Economic and societal factors, such as technological innovation, demographic changes, and government policies, could impact the US's growth potential.\n\nOverall, the question is focused on predicting whether the US will achieve high economic growth in the next decade, and what factors might contribute to this growth. The historical record provides context for what is possible, but the future is uncertain and dependent on a range of economic and societal factors.","examples":[{"example_question":"Will the United States experience an incident of a massive riot in 2020?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the Fed announce a slow-down in bond purchases from the current $120 billion per month before Jan. 1, 2022?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the US unemployment rate stay above 5% through November 2021?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the VIX Index print above 50 in 2019?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the VIX Index reach 15 or below before 9-01-21?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the U.S. enter a recession by July 1, 2021?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Before 1 January 2021, will American Airlines, or any parent company thereof, file for Chapter 7 or Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the Fed raise the RRR this year?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the U.S. enter a recession by July 1, 2020?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0,"example_context":"Entities:\n- U.S.: Refers to the United States of America, a federal republic consisting of 50 states, a federal district, and various territories.\n- Recession: A significant decline in economic activity that lasts for several months or longer.\n\nDates:\n- July 1, 2020: Refers to the date by which the question asks whether the U.S. will enter a recession.\n\nLocations:\n- None specifically mentioned in the question.\n\nOther interesting terms:\n- None specifically mentioned in the question.\n\nHistorical background:\n- The U.S. has experienced several recessions throughout its history, including the Great Depression in the 1930s, the early 1980s recession, and the Great Recession in 2008.\n- Recessions are typically caused by a combination of factors, including a decline in consumer spending, a decrease in business investment, a decrease in government spending, and a decrease in exports.\n- The severity and duration of recessions can vary widely.\n\nImportant economic\/societal considerations:\n- Recessions can have significant economic impacts, including job losses, decreased consumer spending, and decreased business profits.\n- Recessions can also have societal impacts, including increased poverty rates and decreased access to healthcare.\n- There are various measures that can be taken to mitigate the impact of a recession, such as government stimulus spending and monetary policy adjustments.\n\nRelationship between terms:\n- The question asks whether the U.S. will enter a recession by a specific date.\n- The likelihood of a recession occurring can be impacted by various economic and societal factors.\n- The U.S. has experienced recessions in the past, but there is no guarantee that a recession will occur in the future.\n\nRank of importance:\n1.

Federal minimum wage: The minimum wage is the lowest amount of money that an employer can legally pay their employees for their work. The federal minimum wage is the minimum wage rate established by the US federal government that applies to most workers in the country.\n- United States: The United States is a federal republic composed of 50 states, a federal district, five major self-governing territories, and various possessions.\n\nDates:\n- Before 2025: This refers to any time between now and December 31, 2024.\n\nBackground:\nThe federal minimum wage was first established in 1938 as part of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). The initial minimum wage rate was $0.25 per hour, and it has been increased numerous times over the years. The current federal minimum wage rate is $7.25 per hour, which was last increased in 2009.\n\nMany states and cities in the US have their own minimum wage rates that are higher than the federal minimum wage. However, there have been ongoing debates and discussions about increasing the federal minimum wage to keep up with inflation and the rising cost of living.\n\nImportant Economic Considerations:\n- Poverty: The minimum wage is often seen as a tool to combat poverty by ensuring that workers are paid a living wage.\n- Employment: Some argue that increasing the minimum wage could lead to a decrease in employment, particularly for low-skilled workers, as employers may not be able to afford to pay higher wages.\n- Inflation: Increasing the minimum wage could lead to higher prices for goods and services as businesses pass on the higher labor costs to consumers.\n\nImportant Societal Considerations:\n- Income inequality: The minimum wage is often viewed as a way to address income inequality by ensuring that low-wage workers are paid a fair wage.\n- Social mobility: A higher minimum wage could provide workers with more opportunities to move up the economic ladder.\n\nRelationship between Terms:\nThe federal minimum wage is a policy issue that is debated and decided upon by the US federal government. The decision to increase or not increase the minimum wage could have a significant impact on workers, businesses, and the economy as a whole.\n\nImportance Ranking:\n- Federal minimum wage: 5\/5\n- United States: 5\/5\n- Before 2025: 3\/5 (This term is important in the context of the question, but does not have significant historical or economic\/societal background.)","examples":[{"example_question":"Before 1 January 2021, will American Airlines, or any parent company thereof, file for Chapter 7 or Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0,"example_context":"Entities:\n- American Airlines: A major airline in the United States, headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, and operating both domestic and international flights.\n- Parent company: American Airlines Group Inc., a publicly traded company listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbol AAL.\n- Chapter 7 bankruptcy: Also known as liquidation bankruptcy, it involves the sale of a debtor's non-exempt assets by a trustee to repay creditors.\n- Chapter 11 bankruptcy: Also known as reorganization bankruptcy, it allows a debtor to restructure their debts and business operations while retaining control of their assets.\n\nHistorical background:\n- American Airlines was founded in 1930 and has undergone several mergers and acquisitions over the years.\n- The airline filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November 2011 and emerged from it in December 2013 after restructuring its operations and reducing its debt.\n- In 2020, the airline, like many others, suffered a significant financial impact due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in reduced demand for air travel and increased costs for safety measures.\n\nImportant economic or societal considerations:\n- American Airlines is a major employer, with over 133,000 employees worldwide.\n- The airline industry plays a crucial role in the global economy, facilitating business and leisure travel and connecting people and markets.\n\nRelationship between the terms:\n- American Airlines, as a subsidiary of American Airlines Group Inc., is subject to the financial health and decisions of its parent company.\n- The potential bankruptcy filing would be under either Chapter 7 or Chapter 11, depending on the circumstances and goals of the company.\n\nRank of importance:\n1.

{"question":"If a single-payer healthcare system is adopted in the United States, will healthcare spending go down as a fraction of GDP?","id":"M3657","background":"Currently economists are divided on the question of whether single-payer saves money. Some argues that due to increased efficiency and scale, total healthcare spending would go down. Others argue that due to increased use of healthcare, total costs would go up. Assume that before 2050, the United States adopts a single-payer healthcare system, defined as a healthcare service that provides coverage to all citizens in the United States. In the five years after the system is implemented, will healthcare costs go down as a fraction of GDP, compared to the previous five years? The date of implementation is defined as the first day during which some citizens are provided care under a single-payer plan. Statistics will be obtained by averaging the percentage of GDP spent on healthcare, as reported by an official government organization of the United States, during the 5 years prior to implementation and the 5 years after implementation, excluding the year of implementation. For example, if single-player healthcare is implemented in June 2031, then the relevant time-periods for comparison are 2025 - 2030 and 2032 - 2037. This question can close early if a single-payer healthcare system is implemented. If costs go down, this question resolves positively. If costs go up, this question resolves negatively. If a single-payer healthcare system is not implemented in the United States before January 1st 2050, this question resolves ambiguously.","publish_time":1589493600000,"close_time":"2045-01-01

healthcare system: \n\nDefinition: A single-payer healthcare system is a system in which a single public agency organizes healthcare financing, but the delivery of healthcare services remains largely in private hands.\n\nHistorical background: Single-payer healthcare system originated in Europe. In 1883, Germany established the first modern social health insurance system in response to the industrial revolution and urbanization. Since then, many countries have adopted some form of single-payer healthcare system.\n\nEconomic considerations: Single-payer healthcare system has the potential to reduce healthcare costs by lowering administrative costs and negotiating lower prices for medical services and drugs. However, it may also lead to higher taxes to fund the system.\n\nSocietal considerations: Single-payer healthcare system may provide universal coverage and reduce healthcare disparities, but it may also limit patients' choices and access to medical services.\n\nRank of importance: Extremely important.\n\nHealthcare spending: \n\nDefinition: Healthcare spending refers to the amount of money spent on healthcare by individuals, governments, and private entities.\n\nHistorical background: Healthcare spending has been increasing in the United States and other developed countries due to factors such as aging populations, technological advancements, and rising healthcare prices.\n\nEconomic considerations: Healthcare spending can impact the economy by affecting government budgets, private sector employment, and consumer spending.\n\nSocietal considerations: Healthcare spending can affect the affordability and accessibility of healthcare for individuals and communities.\n\nRank of importance: Extremely important.\n\nGDP: \n\nDefinition: GDP (Gross Domestic Product) is the total value of goods and services produced in a country in a given time period.\n\nHistorical background: GDP has been used as a measure of economic growth and development since the 1930s.\n\nEconomic considerations: GDP can reflect the overall health of the economy and impact policies related to taxes, spending, and trade.\n\nSocietal considerations: GDP can affect employment, income, and living standards for individuals and communities.\n\nRank of importance: Very important.\n\nRelationship between terms: The adoption of a single-payer healthcare system in the United States could impact healthcare spending, which in turn could impact GDP. Lower healthcare spending as a fraction of GDP could indicate a more efficient healthcare system, but it could also have broader economic and societal implications.\n\nWhy one term might impact another: Healthcare spending is a significant portion of GDP in the United States, so any changes to the healthcare system could have a notable impact on GDP. Conversely, changes in GDP could also impact healthcare spending by affecting government budgets and consumer spending.","examples":[{"example_question":"Will the Fed raise the RRR this year?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the Democratic candidate win the 2021 Virginia gubernatorial election?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will one of the recall California Governor Gavin Newsom get the required validated signatures and trigger a recall election before Nov 2, 2020?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0,"example_context":"Entities:\n1.

{"question":"Before January 1, 2025, will at least two public health agencies claim that COVID-19 more likely than not originated in a laboratory?","id":"M3682","background":"The beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of COVID-19 outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus. The majority of the cases were epidemiologically linked to seafood, poultry and live wildlife market (Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market) in Jianghan District of Hubei Province. This suggests that the novel coronavirus has a possible zoonotic origin. Some evidence suggests the virus might have originated from bat sub-species. So far, scientists have been unable to conclusively determine the zoological origins of COVID-19. In a recent (but undated) preprint, two Chinese scientists claim that the COVID-19 strain of coronavirus probably originated from a laboratory in Wuhan: In summary, somebody was entangled with the evolution of 2019-nCoV coronavirus. In addition to origins of natural recombination and intermediate host, the killer coronavirus probably originated from a laboratory in Wuhan. The preprint implicates the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the only BSL-4 virology lab in China. Scientists have previously expressed concerns about the organisation's ability to monitor the lab. Other scientists, such as Trevor Bedford, of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle has disputed the theory of the laboratory origins of COVID-19, claiming: \"There is no evidence whatsoever of genetic engineering that we can find\". ETA (2021-07-06) to clarify, this doesn't 'dispute all lab-origins, just those that involve genetic modification. Before January 1, 2025, will at least two public health agencies claim that COVID-19 more likely than not originated in a laboratory? This question will resolve as Yes if before January 1, 2025 at least two of the public health agencies listed below claim that it is more likely than not that SARS-CoV-2 originated from a Chinese virology laboratory. For this question we will consider only statements by the following public health agencies: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (including the Epidemic Intelligence Service) The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (including the Health Threat Unit) World Health Organization The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention The Centre for Health Protection Robert Koch Institute The National Institute of Infectious Diseases Public Health England The National Centre for Infectious Diseases Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Korea The Public Health Agency of Canada In case multiple subdivisions of any of the above agencies make assessments that COVID-19 more likely than not originated from a Chinese virology laboratory, this will only count as single claim made by a single public health agency. Assessments made by these agencies must broadly state that it is more likely than not that COVID-19 originated from a Chinese virology or biology laboratory, after having been released accidentally or deliberately. Synonyms for probability assessments must be considered by an admin to be broadly consistent with at least a 50% chance. Examples of such synonyms include \"probably\", \"likely\", \"with high probability\" and \"almost certainly\".","publish_time":1582070400000,"close_time":"2025-01-01 00:00:00+00:00","tags":["Novel

{"question":"Will at least two public health agencies publicly accuse the Chinese government of deliberately misrepresenting the number of COVID-19 infections before 2025?","id":"M3715","background":"The COVID-19 outbreak in China has been rife with allegations of misrepresentation by Chinese government officials. These began at the local level, where officials in Hubei province potentially under-reported the magnitude of the outbreak in early January to Chinese central government authorities. A public health worker famously released a video around January 26 claiming that at that time, at least 90,000 cases had occurred--at the time the Chinese government was reporting fewer than 2000 infections. Since then, the insufficiently-inclusive strategy of counting only persons with laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 depressed the counts of probable cases. And the patterns of growth in the official counts follow an unexpected distribution, implying the counts may be generated by a model which doesn't accurately represent the dynamics of the disease's spread through the population. This latter allegation is perhaps the most important and severe, as it means that estimations of epidemiological characteristics based on Chinese data may lead to public health interventions which do not reflect the reality of the viral spread. For example, if the R_0 (the average number of people an infected person will pass the virus along to) is underestimated, it may lead to insufficiently aggressive strategies for reducing the propagation of the virus across the globe. However, overestimating it could lead to overly-aggressive quarantining strategies, hobbling international commerce. Getting a proper assessment of the epidemiological dynamics is critical to devising the appropriate public health response. Will at least two public health agencies publicly accuse the Chinese government of deliberately misrepresenting the number of COVID-19 infections before 2025? This question will resolve as Yes if, before January 1, 2025, at least two of the public health agencies listed below claim that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately lied about, fabricated, or misrepresented case or death numbers. If an agency claims that the numbers were flawed, but does not go as far as to suggest deliberate lying or misrepresentation, this will not count. For the purpose of this question, we consider only statements by the following public health agencies: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (including the Epidemic Intelligence Service) The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (including the Health Threat Unit) World Health Organization The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention The Centre for Health Protection Robert Koch Institute The National Institute of Infectious Diseases Public Health England The National Centre for Infectious Diseases Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Korea The Public Health Agency of Canada In case multiple subdivisions of any of the above agencies make assessments that China more likely than not lied about case or death numbers, these will only count as single accusation made by a single agency. The relevant assessments will count if they are judged by Metaculus to broadly state that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately did lie about, fabricate, or misrepresent case or death counts. This question has a short-fuse sister.","publish_time":1582621200000,"close_time":"2025-01-01 04:00:00+00:00","tags":["Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19)","Effective

Public health agencies: These are organizations that are responsible for protecting and improving the health of a population. Examples include the World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n- Chinese government: The government of the People's Republic of China, which is a one-party state led by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).\n\nDates:\n- Before 2025: Refers to any time before January 1, 2025.\n\nLocations:\n- No specific locations are mentioned in the question, but it is implied that the accusations will be made by public health agencies outside of China regarding the Chinese government's handling of COVID-19.\n\nOther terms:\n- COVID-19: A highly infectious respiratory illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus that first emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has since become a global pandemic.\n- Misrepresenting: To provide false or misleading information.\n- Deliberately: To do something intentionally or with purpose.\n\nHistorical background:\n- China was the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak, with the first cases reported in Wuhan in December 2019. The Chinese government initially downplayed the severity of the outbreak and suppressed information about it, leading to delays in the global response and allowing the virus to spread more widely.\n- The Chinese government has been criticized for its handling of the pandemic, including accusations of underreporting the number of cases and deaths. However, the government denies these claims and has insisted that it has been transparent and responsible in its response to the outbreak.\n\nEconomic and societal considerations:\n- Accusations of deliberate misrepresentation by the Chinese government could have significant economic and political implications, particularly for China's relationship with other countries and its global reputation.\n- Public health agencies have a responsibility to provide accurate information about infectious disease outbreaks in order to inform public health policies and interventions. Accusing a government of deliberately misrepresenting data could undermine trust in that government and its ability to handle public health emergencies.\n\nRelationship between terms:\n- The question is asking whether at least two public health agencies will publicly accuse the Chinese government of deliberately misrepresenting the number of COVID-19 infections before 2025. This implies that there is a lack of trust or transparency between the Chinese government and these public health agencies, and that the agencies believe that the government has not been forthcoming about the extent of the pandemic in China.\n- The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis that has had far-reaching economic and societal impacts, and accusations of deliberate misrepresentation could have significant implications for how the pandemic is perceived and addressed.\n\nRank of importance:\n1. COVID-19: The pandemic is the central issue in the question and provides the context for the accusations of misrepresentation.\n2. Chinese government: The question is specifically about the actions of the Chinese government and its handling of the pandemic.\n3. Public health agencies: These are the entities making the accusations and are therefore important to the question.\n4. Misrepresenting\/deliberately: These terms describe the behavior that the question is asking about and are essential to understanding the accusations being made.\n5. Before 2025: The time frame is important for establishing the scope of the question, but is less significant than the other terms.","examples":[{"example_question":"Before 16 December 2021, will the U.S. reimpose a Presidential Proclamation restricting travel from the European Schengen Area?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the US federal government shut down all non-essential services by 2020-04-19?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will EA Global London 2021 be cancelled, rescheduled, or moved online again?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will restrictions on household mixing be in effect in England on 25 December 2021?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will JHU CSSE's COVID-19 dashboard remain open and maintained through 2020-12-31?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0,"example_context":"Entities:\n1.

{"question":"Will the first United States recession before 2032 lead to a Depression?","id":"M4013","background":"As of Spring 2020, it seems likely that the world is only beginning to feel the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The stock market has plunged, and unemployment has skyrocketed. It's clear that a recession is nearly inevitable. What is less clear is how bad things will get. One simple operationalization of this question is \"Will the US Experience a Depression?\" According to Investopedia: A depression is a severe and prolonged downturn in economic activity. In economics, a depression is commonly defined as an extreme recession that lasts three or more years or leads to a decline in real gross domestic product (GDP) of at least 10 percent. According to this definition, Will the first United States recession before 2032 lead to a Depression? This question resolves positively if either of the following criteria is met during the first recession before 2032: The US remains in a recession for 36 months or longer (as adjudicated by this Metaculus Question's resolution--i.e., if that one resolves \u226536, this one resolves positively). Any year's Annual Real GDP growth (as reported by the US Bureau of Economic Analysis) is estimated to be -10% or less.","publish_time":1586242800000,"close_time":"2027-01-01

College-aged U.S. citizens: Refers to individuals who are between the ages of 18 and 24 years and are citizens of the United States. This age group is typically associated with higher education as they are eligible to attend college.\n\n2. Postsecondary educational institutions: Refers to institutions that provide education beyond high school, including colleges, universities, and vocational schools. These institutions offer various degrees and programs, ranging from associate degrees to doctorates.\n\n3. United States: Refers to the country where the postsecondary educational institutions are located. The United States has a diverse higher education system that includes public and private institutions.\n\nHistorical background:\n\nThe higher education system in the United States has a long history, with the first colleges founded in the 17th century. The higher education system has evolved over time, with the expansion of public universities and the introduction of community colleges. The number of postsecondary educational institutions in the United States has grown significantly, with over 5,000 institutions offering higher education programs.\n\nImportant economic or societal considerations:\n\nHigher education is an important factor in the economic and social development of the United States. College graduates typically earn higher salaries and have lower unemployment rates than those without a college degree. Higher education is also associated with improved health outcomes, increased civic engagement, and greater social mobility.\n\nRelationship between the terms:\n\nThe question asks whether the percentage of college-aged U.S. citizens attending postsecondary educational institutions in the United States will drop at least 50% from the level in 2011 by 2040. The question implies that there may be economic or societal factors that could lead to a decline in college attendance among this age group. The relationship between the terms is that the percentage of college-aged U.S. citizens attending postsecondary educational institutions is the main focus of the question, while the baseline year (2011) and the target year (2040) provide a timeframe for the comparison.\n\nWhy one term might impact another:\n\nThere are many factors that could impact the percentage of college-aged U.S. citizens attending postsecondary educational institutions, including economic conditions, changes in the job market, demographic shifts, and changes in educational policy. A decline in college attendance among this age group could have significant implications for the future of the United States, including the economic and social development of the country.","examples":[{"example_question":"Will the U.S. enter a recession by July 1, 2019?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the Fed announce a slow-down in bond purchases from the current $120 billion per month before Jan. 1, 2022?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the U.S. enter a recession by July 1, 2020?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the U.S. default on its debt before 1 November 2021?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the U.S. join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership trade pact in 2021?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the US see mass price controls in 2021?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"When the NYSE closes on Dec 31 2019, will the S&P 500 index be higher than 2,506.85 points?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the US enter a recession by Jan 1, 2020?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will Washington state's Department of Revenue report a gross business income for Q1 2021 that reaches or exceeds pre-COVID levels from Q1 2019?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Before 1 January 2021, will American Airlines, or any parent company thereof, file for Chapter 7 or Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the U.S. enter a recession by July 1, 2021?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the United States experience an incident of a massive riot in 2020?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the VIX Index print above 50 in 2019?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"If the US experiences a recession in 2020, will the number of suicides in the US in 2020 exceed 51,336?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.15},{"example_question":"Will the MOVE Index breach 70 before 11-01-21?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the price of Brent crude oil exceed $70 in 2021?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the US unemployment rate stay above 5% through November 2021?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the VIX Index reach 15 or below before 9-01-21?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0,"example_context":"VIX Index: The VIX Index is a measure of the market's expectation of volatility over the next 30 days, often referred to as the \"fear index.\" It is based on the prices of options on the S&P 500 Index.

{"question":"Longbets series: will the amount of geologically-derived crude oil consumed by the United States in 2035 be greater than the amount consumed in 2015?","id":"M5716","background":"Joseph F. Huttner and Stephen W Snow summarize their reasons for taking the bet here. Joseph F. Huttner argued, 1) The overall population of the United States will continue to increase, largely as a result of immigration. [...] 2) The American electorate is generally unwilling to force themselves to pay more for a given unit of energy than they have to, and geologically-derived crude oil is often the cheapest form of energy available. [...] 3) The solution to credible environmental issues stemming from the burning of fossil fuels is likely to be based on some scientific process which addresses those effects. [...] 4) Much of the geologically-derived crude oil for sale in the world comes from countries that have an under-developed economy. On a political level, it is in the interest of wealthier nations to purchase the exports of poorer nations, and that includes their oil - these transactions not only increase wealth for both nations, but they help foster harmony and peace among the peoples of the world. Stephen W Snow countered, My reasoning is based on economic arguments rather than on an assumption that the drop will be caused by a deliberate policy to reduce fossil carbon use, even though such a policy would be highly desirable to reduce climate change. It seems likely to me that the price of oil will continue to rise as it has done in the past, while the price of renewables, particularly solar photovoltaic, will also follow past trends and continue to fall. Even though the US population and economy will continue to grow I claim that this growth will be more than compensated by improved energy intensity and by substitution of oil with natural gas and renewables. Will the amount of geologically-derived crude oil consumed by the United States in 2035 be greater than the amount consumed in 2015? If the Long Now Foundation declares Joseph F. Huttner the winner, this question resolves positively. If they declare Stephen W Snow the winner, this question resolves negatively.","publish_time":1605553763731,"close_time":"2032-01-01 08:00:00+00:00","tags":["Environment \u2013 Climate","Industry \u2013 Energy","Economy \u2013 US"],"source_links":["https:\/\/longbets.org\/726\/"],"prediction_count":60.0,"forecaster_count":27,"answer":null,"choices":["yes","no"],"status":"Active","qtype":"t\/f","crowd":[{"timestamp":"2020-11-16 19:22:11.917396+00:00","forecast":0.25},{"timestamp":"2020-11-16 21:21:47.556390+00:00","forecast":0.285},{"timestamp":"2020-11-16 21:40:57.246539+00:00","forecast":0.25},{"timestamp":"2020-11-17 00:36:12.838500+00:00","forecast":0.32},{"timestamp":"2020-11-17 03:34:32.761456+00:00","forecast":0.4},{"timestamp":"2020-11-17 05:37:20.984142+00:00","forecast":0.4},{"timestamp":"2020-11-17 11:06:59.922341+00:00","forecast":0.4},{"timestamp":"2020-11-18 07:00:48.564036+00:00","forecast":0.4},{"timestamp":"2020-11-18 08:56:31.550088+00:00","forecast":0.4},{"timestamp":"2020-11-18 19:19:02.254526+00:00","forecast":0.3},{"timestamp":"2020-11-18 20:16:59.783231+00:00","forecast":0.32},{"timestamp":"2020-11-19 02:31:50.307198+00:00","forecast":0.32},{"timestamp":"2020-11-19 04:12:09.622751+00:00","forecast":0.32},{"timestamp":"2020-11-19 05:48:32.914218+00:00","forecast":0.31},{"timestamp":"2020-11-19 05:48:43.485023+00:00","forecast":0.3},{"timestamp":"2020-11-19 07:58:39.438723+00:00","forecast":0.32},{"timestamp":"2020-11-19 22:03:44.455837+00:00","forecast":0.32},{"timestamp":"2020-11-20 19:32:35.127027+00:00","forecast":0.38},{"timestamp":"2020-11-21 06:22:30.031037+00:00","forecast":0.38},{"timestamp":"2020-12-05 04:14:04.911933+00:00","forecast":0.38},{"timestamp":"2020-12-11 05:28:15.216320+00:00","forecast":0.38},{"timestamp":"2020-12-11 05:29:12.495762+00:00","forecast":0.38},{"timestamp":"2020-12-11 05:29:55.752669+00:00","forecast":0.38},{"timestamp":"2020-12-11 05:34:31.861003+00:00","forecast":0.38},{"timestamp":"2020-12-15 00:26:10.795872+00:00","forecast":0.38},{"timestamp":"2020-12-20 02:23:18.496600+00:00","forecast":0.38},{"timestamp":"2021-01-10 21:06:18.361422+00:00","forecast":0.32},{"timestamp":"2021-01-11 04:05:05.081232+00:00","forecast":0.32},{"timestamp":"2021-01-28 10:20:48.098147+00:00","forecast":0.32},{"timestamp":"2021-01-28 10:21:13.176648+00:00","forecast":0.32},{"timestamp":"2021-01-30 19:58:07.458748+00:00","forecast":0.33},{"timestamp":"2021-02-10 15:34:38.498243+00:00","forecast":0.33},{"timestamp":"2021-03-04 05:18:11.432226+00:00","forecast":0.38},{"timestamp":"2021-03-05 03:55:08.671442+00:00","forecast":0.38},{"timestamp":"2021-03-12 03:36:11.304776+00:00","forecast":0.38},{"timestamp":"2021-04-05 03:22:28.690007+00:00","forecast":0.38},{"timestamp":"2021-04-05 03:22:32.085338+00:00","forecast":0.38},{"timestamp":"2021-04-09 06:36:03.036313+00:00","forecast":0.38},{"timestamp":"2021-04-12 04:30:02.307109+00:00","forecast":0.38},{"timestamp":"2021-06-02 08:47:59.675260+00:00","forecast":0.38},{"timestamp":"2021-06-04 17:01:45.886911+00:00","forecast":0.38},{"timestamp":"2021-07-08 11:14:56.779306+00:00","forecast":0.38},{"timestamp":"2021-07-19 04:40:58.076518+00:00","forecast":0.38},{"timestamp":"2021-07-21 06:02:26.132749+00:00","forecast":0.38},{"timestamp":"2021-10-13 10:49:20.400921+00:00","forecast":0.38},{"timestamp":"2022-01-04 06:57:51.634310+00:00","forecast":0.38},{"timestamp":"2022-01-04 23:14:41.332001+00:00","forecast":0.35},{"timestamp":"2022-01-05 23:55:25.283975+00:00","forecast":0.35},{"timestamp":"2022-01-06 18:45:38.123469+00:00","forecast":0.35},{"timestamp":"2022-03-02 08:30:06.605058+00:00","forecast":0.35},{"timestamp":"2022-03-03 22:39:27.920298+00:00","forecast":0.35},{"timestamp":"2022-03-04 12:28:16.478069+00:00","forecast":0.35},{"timestamp":"2022-04-02 08:33:00.302759+00:00","forecast":0.35},{"timestamp":"2022-04-02 16:57:08.720854+00:00","forecast":0.32},{"timestamp":"2022-04-02 16:57:18.646641+00:00","forecast":0.32},{"timestamp":"2022-04-02 18:24:47.010194+00:00","forecast":0.32},{"timestamp":"2022-04-04 08:16:00.947295+00:00","forecast":0.3},{"timestamp":"2022-04-04 23:23:34.348352+00:00","forecast":0.3},{"timestamp":"2022-05-04 03:35:17.160885+00:00","forecast":0.3},{"timestamp":"2022-06-02 21:51:08.020591+00:00","forecast":0.3}],"avg_pred":0.3484166667,"median_pred":0.35,"majority_pred":0.38,"pred_taken":0.38,"acceptable_pred_lower_boundary":0.18,"acceptable_pred_upper_boundary":0.58,"context":"Entities:\n- Geologically-derived crude oil: This refers to crude oil that is extracted from underground reservoirs through drilling and exploration.

{"question":"Longbets series: will the annual rate of US labor productivity growth for the year 2025, as measured by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, be 2 percent or above?","id":"M5865","background":"Robert D Atkinson and Alberto Forchielli summarize their reasons for taking the bet here. Robert D Atkinson argued, U.S. productivity growth is at its lowest rate, perhaps since the founding of the Republic. Some experts, like Robert Gordon, argue that this will be the new new norm, arguing that all the \"low hanging fruit has been picked.\" Rather, a new wave of innovations, grounded in areas such as new materials, robotics and AI, are likely to finally get to the \"s-curve\" take-off point within the next 5 to 10 years, thereby powering organizations to boost labor productivity (eg., produce more per hour of labor) Alberto Forchielli countered, We have not seen 3% productivity growth in USA for many years. Predicting such growth is highly speculative at this point since there are way too many uncertainties. Moreover assuming such growth entails large investment amounts not just in R&D but also downstream. I fear US economy will see itself constrained by China worldwide expansion. Protectionist tendencies and the emergence of formidable Chinese competitors will constrain the development of US companies making it more difficult to achieve high productivity enhancements. In other words, the world economic context will change to such a degree that we will have to revise all our economic and business hypothesis derived from past experiences and extrapolated from futuristic assumptions embedded in history. Will the annual rate of US labor productivity growth for the year 2025, as measured by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, be 2 percent or above? If Robert D Atkinson is declared the winner of the bet by the Long Now Foundation, then this question resolves positively. If Alberto Forchielli is declared the winner, then this question resolves negatively.","publish_time":1607500800000,"close_time":"2025-01-01 08:00:00+00:00","tags":["Economy \u2013 US \u2013 Economic Indicators"],"source_links":["https:\/\/longbets.org\/751\/"],"prediction_count":61.0,"forecaster_count":29,"answer":null,"choices":["yes","no"],"status":"Active","qtype":"t\/f","crowd":[{"timestamp":"2020-12-10 00:51:17.041695+00:00","forecast":0.45},{"timestamp":"2020-12-10 08:42:40.966783+00:00","forecast":0.36},{"timestamp":"2020-12-10 15:38:40.372947+00:00","forecast":0.27},{"timestamp":"2020-12-10 15:40:23.780545+00:00","forecast":0.45},{"timestamp":"2020-12-10 23:44:05.230230+00:00","forecast":0.37},{"timestamp":"2020-12-11 05:34:25.250624+00:00","forecast":0.37},{"timestamp":"2020-12-11 05:35:04.065926+00:00","forecast":0.37},{"timestamp":"2020-12-11 05:35:48.321004+00:00","forecast":0.37},{"timestamp":"2020-12-11 18:24:17.976006+00:00","forecast":0.37},{"timestamp":"2020-12-12 04:51:38.292173+00:00","forecast":0.4},{"timestamp":"2020-12-15 00:26:06.693686+00:00","forecast":0.4},{"timestamp":"2020-12-15 14:25:13.339685+00:00","forecast":0.4},{"timestamp":"2020-12-28 17:10:16.576431+00:00","forecast":0.4},{"timestamp":"2021-01-11 14:56:25.429152+00:00","forecast":0.4},{"timestamp":"2021-01-28 10:09:04.641272+00:00","forecast":0.4},{"timestamp":"2021-01-28 10:17:36.431216+00:00","forecast":0.4},{"timestamp":"2021-01-30 22:14:43.192153+00:00","forecast":0.4},{"timestamp":"2021-02-10 15:29:07.104282+00:00","forecast":0.4},{"timestamp":"2021-02-24 17:29:26.160602+00:00","forecast":0.45},{"timestamp":"2021-02-25 02:09:49.690579+00:00","forecast":0.45},{"timestamp":"2021-02-25 04:16:04.727420+00:00","forecast":0.45},{"timestamp":"2021-02-27 10:59:21.021901+00:00","forecast":0.45},{"timestamp":"2021-03-03 17:26:10.833378+00:00","forecast":0.45},{"timestamp":"2021-03-04 04:57:09.759978+00:00","forecast":0.45},{"timestamp":"2021-03-04 04:57:11.936862+00:00","forecast":0.45},{"timestamp":"2021-04-05 05:57:36.941203+00:00","forecast":0.45},{"timestamp":"2021-04-09 06:37:21.007436+00:00","forecast":0.45},{"timestamp":"2021-04-12 05:23:45.681857+00:00","forecast":0.45},{"timestamp":"2021-06-02 08:49:29.885067+00:00","forecast":0.45},{"timestamp":"2021-06-13 16:24:42.102401+00:00","forecast":0.45},{"timestamp":"2021-06-13 16:48:49.215782+00:00","forecast":0.45},{"timestamp":"2021-06-13 17:00:14.108239+00:00","forecast":0.45},{"timestamp":"2021-06-13 18:55:47.020436+00:00","forecast":0.45},{"timestamp":"2021-06-13 19:29:05.177681+00:00","forecast":0.45},{"timestamp":"2021-06-14 02:01:23.308980+00:00","forecast":0.45},{"timestamp":"2021-06-14 21:05:44.417226+00:00","forecast":0.46},{"timestamp":"2021-06-15 01:31:00.969250+00:00","forecast":0.46},{"timestamp":"2021-06-15 01:31:04.219642+00:00","forecast":0.46},{"timestamp":"2021-06-19 04:16:23.648485+00:00","forecast":0.47},{"timestamp":"2021-07-08 11:16:23.109525+00:00","forecast":0.47},{"timestamp":"2021-07-19 04:04:11.093279+00:00","forecast":0.46},{"timestamp":"2021-07-19 04:41:29.568460+00:00","forecast":0.46},{"timestamp":"2021-07-19 04:57:22.528472+00:00","forecast":0.46},{"timestamp":"2021-07-20 08:26:52.746559+00:00","forecast":0.46},{"timestamp":"2021-10-13 09:38:45.159603+00:00","forecast":0.46},{"timestamp":"2021-10-13 10:47:00.251184+00:00","forecast":0.46},{"timestamp":"2021-11-06 21:29:26.693749+00:00","forecast":0.47},{"timestamp":"2022-01-16 01:34:56.404075+00:00","forecast":0.48},{"timestamp":"2022-01-21 00:52:22.062950+00:00","forecast":0.48},{"timestamp":"2022-02-14 19:23:12.414820+00:00","forecast":0.49},{"timestamp":"2022-02-19 10:28:03.923185+00:00","forecast":0.49},{"timestamp":"2022-03-02 06:42:33.188186+00:00","forecast":0.49},{"timestamp":"2022-03-08 10:25:33.541663+00:00","forecast":0.49},{"timestamp":"2022-04-03 21:28:58.852517+00:00","forecast":0.49},{"timestamp":"2022-04-04 00:10:59.584627+00:00","forecast":0.49},{"timestamp":"2022-05-04 03:32:27.938834+00:00","forecast":0.49},{"timestamp":"2022-05-11 10:39:17.022627+00:00","forecast":0.49},{"timestamp":"2022-05-26 00:51:17.843466+00:00","forecast":0.49},{"timestamp":"2022-06-11 04:37:21.623231+00:00","forecast":0.49},{"timestamp":"2022-06-14 02:09:30.466423+00:00","forecast":0.48},{"timestamp":"2022-06-15 00:11:13.756378+00:00","forecast":0.48}],"avg_pred":0.4426229508,"median_pred":0.45,"majority_pred":0.45,"pred_taken":0.45,"acceptable_pred_lower_boundary":0.25,"acceptable_pred_upper_boundary":0.65,"context":"Entities:\n- U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS): The BLS is a government agency that collects, processes, analyzes, and disseminates statistical data on labor economics and statistics in the United States.

Robert D Atkinson argued, Increasingly a large number of pundits and scholars, including Eric Brynjolfsson, Martin Ford, Andrew McAfee, and Vivek Wadhwa, have argued that technology is rapidly advancing and will soon lead large scale displacement of workers with technology. These views have rapidly become the prevailing wisdom regarding emerging technology with the result being that voters and policy makers are now more likely to resist technological change and automation, rather than embrace it. But the \"robots are killing our jobs\" proponents miss the fact that automation lowers prices (or raises wages) which in turn spurs increased demand for goods and services, and hence labor. As such there is no reason to believe that either unemployment or the share of adults in the workforce will decline in any significantly way going forward. Alberto Forchielli countered, The United States will certainly experience a recession in the next six years. As a result, the workforce participation rate will fall below 60 percent and this time, automation and de-industrialization will keep it there at least through June 2025. Will the June, 2025 Labor Force Participation Rate and unemployment rate, reported by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, be, respectively above 60 percent and below 7.5 percent?? If Robert D Atkinson is declared the winner of the bet by the Long Now Foundation, then this question resolves positively. If Jason W Galbraith is declared the winner, then this question resolves negatively.","publish_time":1607500800000,"close_time":"2024-01-01 08:00:00+00:00","tags":["Economy \u2013 US \u2013 Economic Indicators"],"source_links":["https:\/\/longbets.org\/687\/"],"prediction_count":59.0,"forecaster_count":23,"answer":null,"choices":["yes","no"],"status":"Active","qtype":"t\/f","crowd":[{"timestamp":"2020-12-10 00:50:05.954248+00:00","forecast":0.7},{"timestamp":"2020-12-10 06:43:26.009294+00:00","forecast":0.475},{"timestamp":"2020-12-10 06:46:18.048042+00:00","forecast":0.725},{"timestamp":"2020-12-10 07:39:40.101258+00:00","forecast":0.7},{"timestamp":"2020-12-10 08:45:01.558114+00:00","forecast":0.75},{"timestamp":"2020-12-10 15:30:18.346436+00:00","forecast":0.75},{"timestamp":"2020-12-10 18:09:18.977448+00:00","forecast":0.85},{"timestamp":"2020-12-10 19:26:37.120144+00:00","forecast":0.8},{"timestamp":"2020-12-10 19:45:52.296830+00:00","forecast":0.8},{"timestamp":"2020-12-10 21:40:17.199243+00:00","forecast":0.8},{"timestamp":"2020-12-10 21:41:03.146312+00:00","forecast":0.83},{"timestamp":"2020-12-10 22:57:30.770863+00:00","forecast":0.8},{"timestamp":"2020-12-11 03:03:33.223077+00:00","forecast":0.75},{"timestamp":"2020-12-11 05:34:25.458954+00:00","forecast":0.75},{"timestamp":"2020-12-11 05:35:04.301829+00:00","forecast":0.75},{"timestamp":"2020-12-11 05:35:48.577572+00:00","forecast":0.75},{"timestamp":"2020-12-11 14:19:18.990260+00:00","forecast":0.75},{"timestamp":"2020-12-11 14:19:27.323179+00:00","forecast":0.75},{"timestamp":"2020-12-11 18:24:53.767662+00:00","forecast":0.51},{"timestamp":"2020-12-12 04:50:33.072224+00:00","forecast":0.51},{"timestamp":"2020-12-13 13:47:10.121496+00:00","forecast":0.51},{"timestamp":"2020-12-15 06:02:59.354489+00:00","forecast":0.51},{"timestamp":"2020-12-15 14:25:03.154242+00:00","forecast":0.51},{"timestamp":"2020-12-15 22:35:07.719411+00:00","forecast":0.51},{"timestamp":"2020-12-28 17:07:31.339516+00:00","forecast":0.51},{"timestamp":"2021-01-28 10:09:09.308793+00:00","forecast":0.51},{"timestamp":"2021-01-28 10:09:27.575307+00:00","forecast":0.51},{"timestamp":"2021-02-10 15:30:04.389602+00:00","forecast":0.51},{"timestamp":"2021-03-04 04:40:18.238019+00:00","forecast":0.51},{"timestamp":"2021-04-02 20:03:25.534276+00:00","forecast":0.51},{"timestamp":"2021-04-05 03:21:09.870770+00:00","forecast":0.51},{"timestamp":"2021-04-09 06:35:39.065457+00:00","forecast":0.51},{"timestamp":"2021-04-11 09:25:36.542380+00:00","forecast":0.51},{"timestamp":"2021-04-12 04:29:42.732252+00:00","forecast":0.51},{"timestamp":"2021-06-02 08:47:37.829763+00:00","forecast":0.51},{"timestamp":"2021-07-08 11:14:46.806318+00:00","forecast":0.51},{"timestamp":"2021-07-19 03:56:27.654989+00:00","forecast":0.51},{"timestamp":"2021-07-19 04:40:40.364597+00:00","forecast":0.51},{"timestamp":"2021-07-20 08:21:47.062598+00:00","forecast":0.51},{"timestamp":"2021-08-09 17:47:26.270834+00:00","forecast":0.51},{"timestamp":"2021-08-26 13:05:13.258313+00:00","forecast":0.51},{"timestamp":"2021-10-05 21:59:21.307194+00:00","forecast":0.51},{"timestamp":"2021-10-07 01:20:46.781844+00:00","forecast":0.51},{"timestamp":"2021-10-13 07:47:14.385617+00:00","forecast":0.51},{"timestamp":"2021-11-02 13:37:44.816283+00:00","forecast":0.51},{"timestamp":"2022-01-11 02:37:42.891526+00:00","forecast":0.51},{"timestamp":"2022-02-13 19:51:40.702507+00:00","forecast":0.51},{"timestamp":"2022-02-19 08:20:34.330303+00:00","forecast":0.51},{"timestamp":"2022-02-28 04:53:56.279941+00:00","forecast":0.51},{"timestamp":"2022-03-04 19:50:52.889291+00:00","forecast":0.51},{"timestamp":"2022-04-02 08:31:58.834823+00:00","forecast":0.51},{"timestamp":"2022-04-03 21:28:18.726136+00:00","forecast":0.51},{"timestamp":"2022-04-04 00:10:35.520678+00:00","forecast":0.51},{"timestamp":"2022-05-04 03:32:09.688685+00:00","forecast":0.51},{"timestamp":"2022-05-11 09:49:35.535712+00:00","forecast":0.54},{"timestamp":"2022-05-14 02:14:59.864908+00:00","forecast":0.54},{"timestamp":"2022-06-11 04:26:17.152988+00:00","forecast":0.54},{"timestamp":"2022-06-11 22:17:02.680851+00:00","forecast":0.54},{"timestamp":"2022-06-14 02:09:30.796497+00:00","forecast":0.55}],"avg_pred":0.5855932203,"median_pred":0.51,"majority_pred":0.51,"pred_taken":0.51,"acceptable_pred_lower_boundary":0.31,"acceptable_pred_upper_boundary":0.71,"context":"Terms:\n1.

Politburo - The Politburo of the Communist Party of China (CPC) is a 25-member group that is responsible for setting policies and making important decisions within the party and the country.

Chinese State Media - This refers to the official media outlets controlled by the Chinese government, including Xinhua News Agency, China Central Television (CCTV), and People's Daily. \n\nDates: \n\n1. 26 January 2021 - This is the starting date for the time period in which the question is asking about. \n\n2. 31 December 2021 - This is the ending date for the time period in which the question is asking about. \n\nHistorical Background: \n\n1. The Politburo has been a key feature of the Chinese Communist Party since its inception in 1921. \n\n2. In recent years, Chinese President Xi Jinping has carried out a high-profile anti-corruption campaign that has led to the arrest and expulsion of many high-ranking officials. \n\n3. Chinese state media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion and promoting the policies of the Communist Party. \n\nImportant Economic or Societal Considerations: \n\n1. The stability of the Chinese Communist Party is crucial to the stability of the Chinese economy. \n\n2. The anti-corruption campaign has been seen by many as a way for Xi Jinping to consolidate power and eliminate potential rivals. \n\n3. The role of the media in China is tightly controlled by the government, and the extent to which it reports on corruption cases can have a significant impact on public perception of the issue. \n\nRelationship Between Terms: \n\n1. The Politburo is a key decision-making body within the Communist Party and its members are among the most powerful political figures in China. \n\n2. Chinese state media is responsible for reporting on the activities of the party and its officials, including cases of corruption or other wrongdoing. \n\n3. The question is asking about the number of Politburo members who will be arrested or expelled, and how this will be reported by state media. \n\nRank of Importance: \n\n1. Politburo - 5\/5 \n\n2.

The role of the Politburo in setting policies and making decisions is crucial, and any disruptions to its membership could have significant implications for the party and the country as a whole. The role of state media in reporting on these issues is also important, as it can shape public perception and affect the legitimacy of the party's anti-corruption campaign."},"lowest_uncertainty":0.0,"highest_uncertainty":0.7,"average_uncertainty":0.226,"external_context":"The US Bureau of Labor Statistics provides predictions for labor force participation rate and unemployment rate through their Employment Projections (EP) program.

Fund, a mutual fund that tracks the performance of the entire U.S. stock market, including small-, mid-, and large-cap stocks.\n\nDates:\n- 2021-Mar-01 until 2026: A five-year period starting on March 1st, 2021, and ending on February 28th, 2026.\n\nRelationship between entities:\nThe question is asking whether Bitcoin will outperform VTI over a five-year period. This implies a comparison between the performance of a cryptocurrency and a stock market index fund. The answer to this question could have implications for investors who are deciding where to allocate their funds.\n\nImportance ranking of entities:\n- Bitcoin: High. As a decentralized digital currency, Bitcoin has gained widespread attention and investment in recent years. Its value has been highly volatile, with significant price fluctuations and debates about its long-term sustainability.\n- VTI: High. As a popular index fund that tracks the entire U.S. stock market, VTI is a widely used benchmark for investors. Its performance is closely watched by financial professionals and individual investors alike.\n\nLocations:\nN\/A\n\nOther interesting terms:\n- Cryptocurrency: A digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security and operates independently of a central bank. Bitcoin is one example of a cryptocurrency.\n- Index fund: A type of mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks a particular market index, such as the S&P 500 or the Total Stock Market Index. VTI is an example of an index fund.\n\nHistorical background:\nBitcoin was created in 2009 by an unknown person or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Since then, it has gained popularity as a decentralized alternative to traditional currencies and has been used for online transactions and as a speculative investment. The value of Bitcoin has been highly volatile, with significant price fluctuations and debates about its long-term sustainability. VTI was launched in 2001 by Vanguard and has since become one of the most popular index funds in the market, with over $1 trillion in assets under management.\n\nImportant economic or societal considerations:\nThe performance of Bitcoin and VTI over a five-year period could have significant implications for investors. Bitcoin has been touted by some as a hedge against inflation and a store of value, while others have criticized it as a speculative bubble with no intrinsic value. VTI, on the other hand, represents a broad cross-section of the U.S. stock market and is considered by many to be a reliable long-term investment. The performance of these two assets could also reflect broader economic trends and market conditions, such as changes in interest rates or shifts in investor sentiment.","examples":[{"example_question":"Will Washington state's Department of Revenue report a gross business income for Q1 2021 that reaches or exceeds pre-COVID levels from Q1 2019?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the VIX Index reach 15 or below before 9-01-21?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the British Pound trade at equal to or less than $1.000 at any time before January 1, 2020?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"I","uncertainty":0.05},{"example_question":"Will the price of Brent crude oil exceed $70 in 2021?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Before 1 January 2021, will American Airlines, or any parent company thereof, file for Chapter 7 or Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the publicly-traded company GameStop (GME) reach a $420.69 stock price by the end of 2021?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the price of bitcoin drop below $10K USD in 2021?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"I","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"With there be another major cryptocurrency \"split\" in November 2017?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will Elon Musk be the richest person in the world at any point during the 2020s?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the VIX Index print above 50 in 2019?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.6},{"example_question":"Will China's debt accumulation lead to a crash in 2017?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Before January 1 2021, will the FOMC announce that the federal funds target rate is equal to or less than 0%, or, if a target range is given, will the lower bound of that target range be equal to or less than 0%?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the U.S. default on its debt before 1 November 2021?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0,"example_context":"Entities:\n- U.S.: refers to the United States of America, a federal republic consisting of 50 states, a federal district, and several territories.\n- Default: refers to the failure to pay back debt obligations on time.\n- Debt: refers to the total amount of money owed by the U.S. government to its creditors.\n\nDates:\n- 1 November 2021: refers to the deadline by which the U.S. government must raise the debt ceiling to avoid defaulting on its debt.\n\nLocations:\n- None.\n\nImportant terms:\n- Debt ceiling: refers to the statutory limit on the amount of money the U.S. government can borrow to fund its operations.

High inflation rates can lead to increased uncertainty and decreased investment, while low inflation rates can lead to stagnation and decreased economic growth.\n- Factors that can impact inflation rates include changes in the money supply, shifts in supply and demand for goods and services, and changes in government policies (such as fiscal or monetary policy).\n\nImportant societal considerations:\n- High inflation rates can disproportionately impact low-income households, as they may have less flexibility in adjusting their spending to keep up with rising prices.\n- High inflation rates can also lead to social unrest, as individuals and businesses may become frustrated with the economic conditions.\n\nRelationship between terms:\n- The question is asking whether the U.S. will experience an inflation rate of 100% in any year before 2050. This implies that there is concern about the potential for high inflation rates in the future.\n- The relationship between inflation and societal and economic considerations is complex, as inflation can impact different groups in different ways. Therefore, understanding the potential for high inflation rates is important for policymakers and individuals alike.\n\nRanking of importance:\n1.

{"question":"Will the US forgive $10,000 of federal student loans per person before 2024?","id":"M7154","background":"President Joe Biden of the United States has announced plans to forgive at least $10,000 in federal student loan debt per person. Some Democrats have called for $50,000 to be forgiven per person. He has asked for this to be done through Congress, but more recently he has also been considering directly taking executive action for loan cancellation. On April 1, he requested Education Secretary Miguel Cardona to write a memo exploring how much student debt the president is legally able to forgive. As for the timeline of when student loan forgiveness may happen, CNBC's \"$10,000 student loan forgiveness: Can Biden eliminate the debt?\" (May 1, 2021) writes: If Biden chooses to cancel the debt through executive action, in theory borrowers could see their balances reduced or eliminated pretty quickly. But such a move may be met by court challenges, which could lead to delays. A clearer picture may soon emerge. \u201cIf Biden decides he can do it via executive order, I expect we\u2019ll hear about it by June or July,\u201d said Betsy Mayotte, president of The Institute of Student Loan Advisors. If the White House opts to leave student loan forgiveness to Congress, Democrats would likely use the budget reconciliation process to get it done. That\u2019s because that process allows them to pass legislation with a simple majority, which is all they have. Other bills typically must garner 60 votes to advance, thanks to Senate procedural rules. Republicans are largely hostile toward the idea of a student debt jubilee. The next budget reconciliation process will likely be in the fall. Expert opinions on whether loan forgiveness will hapepn (Time, April 29, 2021): \u201cA blanket $10,000 in student loan forgiveness is good for individuals, but it\u2019s bad policy unless they do something to fix the system,\u201d says Robert Farrington, CEO and founder of The College Investor. \u201cI personally don\u2019t think anything will pass.\u201d \u201cI would like to see a higher education reform package if there is student loan forgiveness,\u201d Farrington says. \u201cIf Biden tries to do it by executive order, I would not expect it happening right away. It\u2019ll probably get tied up with lawsuits and litigation. However, if Congress manages to pass a bill that allows student loan forgiveness sometime this summer, then I think it would happen right away.\u201d \u201cI think the $10,000 in forgiveness is likely, but I\u2019m cautious about anything more than that,\u201d says Laurel Taylor, CEO and founder of FutureFuel.io. Will the US forgive $10,000 of federal student loans per person before 2024? This question resolves positively if before January 1, 2024, a presidential executive order is signed or a Congressional bill is signed into law (or other legal means are used) that cancels at least $10,000 of US federal student loan debt for each person, and there is credible evidence that at least one student actually has received the promised debt cancellation from the bill or executive order before January 1, 2024. The debt cancellation should apply to the vast majority of applicable people. There may be restrictions on who is eligible for loan forgiveness of $10,000, but these restrictions must not withhold debt cancellation from more than 10% of American citizens at least 21 years old with at least $1,000 of federal student debt. If it is unclear whether the restrictions are more strict or less strict than this, the moderators can use their discretion as to whether loan forgiveness applies to the vast majority of applicable people. If the conditions above are not met, the question resolves negatively. For example, if the bill or executive order is declared unconstitutional before any student receives debt forgiveness, the question resolves negatively.

The year mentioned in the question as a deadline for the potential forgiveness of federal student loans.\n\nSpecial terms:\n- Forgiveness: The act of canceling or eliminating a debt or loan obligation.\n- $10,000: The specific amount of federal student loan forgiveness mentioned in the question.\n- Student loans: Loans taken out by individuals to pay for higher education, with repayment typically beginning after the borrower has completed their education.\n\nHistorical background:\n- The federal government has been providing student loans to help individuals pay for higher education since the 1950s.\n- The Higher Education Act of 1965 made it easier for students to access federal student loans and established a framework for repayment.\n- The cost of higher education has been increasing faster than inflation for several decades, leading to higher levels of student debt.\n- In recent years, there have been calls for the government to provide relief for borrowers struggling with high levels of student debt.\n\nEconomic and societal considerations:\n- Student loan debt is a significant financial burden for many borrowers, and can impact their ability to purchase homes, start businesses, or save for retirement.\n- Forgiveness of federal student loans would likely have a significant impact on the federal budget and could require the government to find alternative ways to fund higher education.\n- There is debate over whether student loan forgiveness would primarily benefit wealthier individuals who have already paid off their loans or those who are struggling the most with debt.\n- The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased calls for student loan forgiveness as many borrowers are facing financial hardship.\n\nRanking:\n- Forgiveness: High importance, as it is the central action being considered in the question.\n- $10,000: Medium importance, as it is a specific amount being considered for forgiveness.\n- Federal student loans: High importance, as they are the subject of the potential forgiveness.\n- Borrowers: High importance, as they are the individuals who would be impacted by the forgiveness.\n- 2024: Low importance, as it is simply a deadline

President Biden has expressed support for forgiving up to $10,000 per borrower, but there is no guarantee that this will happen before 2024. The decision ultimately lies with Congress, and there are differing opinions on the matter. Some argue that it would provide much-needed relief for struggling borrowers, while others believe it would be unfair to those who have already paid off their loans or never took out loans in the first place.

On October 19, 1987 (so-called Black Monday), the S&P fell 20.47%, the largest movement in its history, which has yet to be surpassed. Generally, when the stock market makes a sudden move, it indicates that there has been some economic shock, such as when the S&P 500 fell 11.98% during the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. Will the S&P 500 rise or fall more than 15% in a single day during the 2020s? This question resolves positively if before January 1st 2030 and after January 1st 2020, the S&P 500 moves by more than 15.0% from opening to closing price, in a single

Wakana was critical of a tweet by the New York Times that implied that vaccinated people were just as likely to spread the delta variant of COVID-19 as unvaccinated people. Nate Silver suggested that twitter should flag the New York Times tweet for being misinformation. Will Twitter flag any tweet by the New York Times as misinformation before 2025? This question resolves positive if Twitter flags a tweet by @nytimes as misinformation by 2025. \"Flagging\" is defined as putting a link in a tweet to some information that contradicts the claims made in the tweet. Otherwise, it resolves negative.","publish_time":1629270000000,"close_time":"2023-07-12 03:00:00+00:00","tags":["Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19)","Social issues","Politics \u2013

{"question":"Will US core CPI inflation rise by more than 3% from December 2021 to December 2022?","id":"M7977","background":"This question is linked to a fortified essay by Arnold Kling on two competing theories of inflation. The resolution of this question is meant to support or undermine his preferred theory. Read the essay to learn more about how this question applies to the 'Government Debt Theory' of inflation. The CPI, or Consumer Price Index, is one of the most widely used measures of inflation by investors. Created by analyzing the price of a certain basket of widely used, urban consumer goods over time with relation to a base time, the CPI can show either monthly or yearly price fluctuations. The CPI for specific cities, types of goods, and by wage-earners can also be calculated. Complete CPI data is released monthly by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (series CUUR0000SA0L1E). If the CPI rises, showing a positive percent increase in inflation, goods will become more expensive in the future, thereby decreasing the purchasing power of savings and increasing the amount necessary to pay back on loans of all kinds. Will the core CPI rise by more than 3% between December 2021 and December 2022? This resolves according to data by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (series CUUR0000SA0L1E).","publish_time":1631768400000,"close_time":"2023-01-31 23:00:00+00:00","tags":["Economy \u2013 US \u2013

US: The United States of America is a federal republic consisting of 50 states and a federal district. It is the world's third-largest country by population and the fourth-largest by land area.\n2. CPI: The Consumer Price Index is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services.\n3. Inflation: Inflation is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising, and subsequently, the purchasing power of currency is falling.\n\nDates:\n1. December 2021: This is the starting point of the period being analyzed in this question.\n2. December 2022: This is the end point of the period being analyzed in this question.\n\nImportance Ranking:\n1. CPI: High importance, as it is the key metric being used to measure inflation in this question.\n2. Inflation: High importance, as it is the focus of the question.\n3. US: Medium importance, as the question is specific to the US economy.\n4. December 2021 and December 2022: Low importance, as they are simply the time period being analyzed.\n\nHistorical Background:\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) was first introduced by the US government in 1913. It is now widely used as a measure of inflation and is used by policymakers to make decisions about economic policy. Inflation has been a persistent concern in the US economy, with periods of high inflation in the 1970s and early 1980s leading to the implementation of tighter monetary policy by the Federal Reserve.\n\nEconomic and Societal Considerations:\nInflation can have significant economic and societal implications. High inflation can erode the value of savings and fixed-income investments, while also leading to higher borrowing costs. It can also have negative impacts on consumer confidence and spending, as individuals may feel less confident about their ability to afford goods and services. On the other hand, low inflation can lead to concerns about deflation and stagnation, which can also have negative economic impacts.\n\nRelationship Between Terms:\nThe question is asking whether the US core CPI inflation will rise by more than 3% from December 2021 to December 2022. The CPI is the measure being used to gauge inflation, while the timeframe being analyzed is from December 2021 to December 2022. The question is asking specifically about core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices. The question is also focused on the US economy, and does not take into account global economic factors.\n\nOverall, the question is asking about the potential for inflationary pressures in the US economy over a specific timeframe, and the potential impacts this could have on various economic and societal factors.","examples":[{"example_question":"Will the US see mass price controls in 2021?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the VIX Index print above 50 in 2019?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will Apple close its flagship 5th Ave store for a period of two weeks or longer before April 2021?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the U.S. enter a recession by July 1, 2020?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the US unemployment rate stay above 5% through November 2021?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the MOVE Index breach 70 before 11-01-21?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the Q2 2020 Delinquency Rate on Residential Mortgages be higher than that in Q1 2020?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the U.S. enter a recession by July 1, 2019?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"In 2022, for any month where US core CPI inflation is more than 3 percent (here, month-over-month annualized inflation), will inflation be at most 3 percentage points higher than the three-month commercial paper interest rate?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the US-China trade war escalate after the initial truce period ending 24 February 2019?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"When the NYSE closes on Dec 31 2019, will the S&P 500 index be higher than 2,506.85 points?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the Fed raise the RRR this year?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the U.S. enter a recession by July 1, 2021?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the US enter a recession by Jan 1, 2020?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the United States experience an incident of a massive riot in 2020?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0,"example_context":"Entities:\n1.

{"question":"Will a US Democratic President sign into law a $500 billion spending cut before 2029?","id":"M7978","background":"This question is linked to a fortified essay by Arnold Kling on two competing theories of inflation. The resolution of this question is meant to support or undermine his preferred theory. Read the essay to learn more about how this question applies to the 'Government Debt Theory' of inflation. A governmental Debt Crisis occurs when a government finds itself unable to pay back its debt. This famously happened to Greece starting in 2009, and to Latin America in the 1980s. Though fears of a Debt Crisis resurface regularly in the US, it has not happened yet. A likely consequence and reaction to a Debt Crisis in the US would be dramatic spending cuts, to balance the budget. The current US President is Joe Biden, a Democrat, and Democrats have a reputation for being less fiscally conservative than Republicans, so this question asks: Will a US Democratic President sign into law a $500 billion spending cut before 2029? This resolves positive if, before 2029, a Democratic US President signs into law a budget that provides for 500 billion dollars less in spending than the budget of the previous year.","publish_time":1631768400000,"close_time":"2028-12-30 23:00:00+00:00","tags":["Politics \u2013 US","Economy \u2013

While there is no clear answer to this question, it is important to note that the current political climate and potential future policies related to spending cuts by a Democratic President are influenced by a variety of factors. One factor is the ongoing debate over the role of government spending in the economy and the impact of spending cuts on various programs and services. Another factor is the political makeup of Congress and the ability of a President to pass legislation. It is also worth noting that President Biden's proposed budget does not include a $500 billion spending cut, but rather proposes increased spending in various areas such as infrastructure, education, and healthcare. Ultimately, the answer to this question will depend on a variety of factors and cannot be predicted with certainty."}
{"question":"Will the Fed decrease the size of its accumulated asset portfolio below $8 trillion by 2023?","id":"M8299","background":"The U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s policy responses to the economic lockdown caused by the pandemic include massive bond purchases that make it cheaper for the government and corporations to issue debt, thus providing an important lifeline for financial activity at a time of difficulty. This is creating a massive asset portfolio (\u201cReserve Bank credit\u201d) that the debt holds, which was at $8.4 trillion as of Sep 29, according to this release. The concern is such steps may contribute to price bubbles in markets and economic overheating due to excessive risk-taking. The opposite concern is that a quick asset selloff may create a market glut, lowering the cost of raising capital for companies. Will the Fed decrease the size of its accumulated asset portfolio below $8 trillion by 2023? This resolves positive if, by Jan. 1, 2023, assets held by the Fed, according to estimates published here, are below $8 trillion.","publish_time":1634792400000,"close_time":"2022-12-31

The Fed: The Federal Reserve System, the central banking system of the United States\n- Asset portfolio: The collection of assets held by the Fed, including Treasury securities, mortgage-backed securities, and other securities\n\nDates:\n- 2023: The year in which the question asks if the Fed will decrease its asset portfolio below $8 trillion\n\nRanking of importance:\n1. Fed\n2. Asset portfolio\n3. $8 trillion\n4. 2023\n\nBackground:\n- The Fed: The Federal Reserve System was created in 1913 to provide a stable and flexible monetary and financial system for the United States. It is composed of twelve regional banks and a Board of Governors in Washington D.C. The Fed is responsible for implementing monetary policy, supervising and regulating banks, and maintaining the stability of the financial system.\n- Asset portfolio: The Fed's asset portfolio is a key tool used in implementing monetary policy. By buying and selling securities, the Fed can influence the money supply and interest rates in the economy. Following the 2008 financial crisis, the Fed embarked on a program of quantitative easing, purchasing large amounts of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities in order to stimulate the economy and lower long-term interest rates.\n- $8 trillion: The $8 trillion figure refers to the size of the Fed's asset portfolio. As of August 2021, the Fed's total assets stood at approximately $8.2 trillion. The size of the Fed's asset portfolio has grown significantly since the financial crisis, and some analysts have expressed concern that the large amount of assets could lead to inflation or other economic problems.\n- 2023: The year 2023 is significant because it is the year in which the question asks whether the Fed will decrease the size of its asset portfolio below $8 trillion. The exact timing of any such reduction would depend on a variety of economic and financial factors.\n\nRelationships:\n- The size of the Fed's asset portfolio is closely tied to its role in implementing monetary policy. Changes in the size and composition of the portfolio can have significant effects on the economy, including on inflation, interest rates, and financial stability.\n- The $8 trillion figure is significant because it represents a large amount of assets held by the Fed. Some economists and policymakers have expressed concern that such a large amount of assets could pose risks to the economy if not managed properly.\n- The year 2023 is significant because it represents a specific point in time at which the question is asking whether the Fed will take a specific action. The timing of any such action would depend on a variety of factors, including economic conditions and the Fed's assessment of the risks and benefits of reducing the size of its asset portfolio.","examples":[{"example_question":"Will the United States experience an incident of a massive riot in 2020?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will Elon Musk be the richest person in the world at any point during the 2020s?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the U.S. enter a recession by July 1, 2020?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"If the US experiences a recession in 2020, will the number of suicides in the US in 2020 exceed 51,336?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the US see mass price controls in 2021?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the US unemployment rate stay above 5% through November 2021?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the VIX Index print above 50 in 2019?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the VIX Index reach 15 or below before 9-01-21?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the US enter a recession by Jan 1, 2020?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the U.S. join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership trade pact in 2021?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the U.S. enter a recession by July 1, 2019?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"In 2022, for any month where US core CPI inflation is more than 3 percent (here, month-over-month annualized inflation), will inflation be at most 3 percentage points higher than the three-month commercial paper interest rate?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the MOVE Index breach 70 before 11-01-21?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Before 1 January 2021, will American Airlines, or any parent company thereof, file for Chapter 7 or Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.15},{"example_question":"Will the Fed announce a slow-down in bond purchases from the current $120 billion per month before Jan. 1, 2022?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"When the NYSE closes on Dec 31 2019, will the S&P 500 index be higher than 2,506.85 points?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the price of Brent crude oil exceed $70 in 2021?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will Washington state's Department of Revenue report a gross business income for Q1 2021 that reaches or exceeds pre-COVID levels from Q1 2019?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the U.S. default on its debt before 1 November 2021?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"At any point before January 1 2023, will the US unemployment rate meet or exceed 10%?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0,"example_context":"Entities:\n1.

{"question":"Will unemployment be useful in forecasting the inflation rate in the same year given the inflation rate in the previous year?","id":"M8322","background":"Phillips curves are a class of models which propose connections between the inflation rate and the unemployment rate in an economy. If there is some such relationship, we might expect that knowing both today's unemployment rate and last year's inflation rate allows us to forecast this year's inflation rate better than just relying on last year's inflation rate alone. To this end, let \u03c0 t , u t denote the inflation rate and the unemployment rate for the United States in the year t respectively. We can then run the following ordinary least squared regressions from the year 2022 to the year 2031 inclusive: (1) \u03c0 t =\u03b1+\u03b2 \u03c0 t\u22121 + \u03b5 t (2) \u03c0 t =\u03b1+ \u03b2 1 \u03c0 t\u22121 + \u03b2 2 u t + \u03b5 t The adjusted coefficient of determination is a measure of how much of the variance in the dependent variable is explained by the regression that corrects for the number of independent variables so as to control for the effect of overfitting. Ideally, the adjusted coefficient of determination only goes up when we add an additional independent variable to a regression if the additional variable is actually useful in predicting the dependent variable. We ask the following question: Will unemployment be useful in forecasting the inflation rate in the same year given the inflation rate in the previous year? This question resolves positively if the adjusted coefficient of determination of the second regression strictly exceeds that of the first regression, and resolves negatively otherwise. Here, \u03c0 t is the end-of-year CPI inflation for the United States obtained from here for the year t (meaning the year-on-year CPI inflation rate measured in December of that year) and u t is the end-of-year unemployment rate for the United States obtained from here for the year t .","publish_time":1635541200000,"close_time":"2025-12-31 21:00:00+00:00","tags":["Economy \u2013 US \u2013 Economic Indicators"],"source_links":["https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Phillips_curve","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Coefficient_of_determination#Adjusted_R2","https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/CPIAUCSL","https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/UNRATE"],"prediction_count":22.0,"forecaster_count":10,"answer":null,"choices":["yes","no"],"status":"Active","qtype":"t\/f","crowd":[{"timestamp":"2021-10-30 19:33:19.636511+00:00","forecast":0.39},{"timestamp":"2021-10-31 03:26:40.347307+00:00","forecast":0.39},{"timestamp":"2021-11-01 00:55:45.483296+00:00","forecast":0.39},{"timestamp":"2021-11-01 05:02:20.577216+00:00","forecast":0.48},{"timestamp":"2021-11-01 16:02:39.498375+00:00","forecast":0.48},{"timestamp":"2021-11-02 09:09:33.531729+00:00","forecast":0.48},{"timestamp":"2021-11-02 20:21:20.062302+00:00","forecast":0.48},{"timestamp":"2021-11-07 01:10:56.912751+00:00","forecast":0.48},{"timestamp":"2021-11-19 00:40:02.400201+00:00","forecast":0.48},{"timestamp":"2021-12-07 01:33:06.156533+00:00","forecast":0.48},{"timestamp":"2022-02-19 11:37:28.595259+00:00","forecast":0.48},{"timestamp":"2022-03-02 02:23:40.401746+00:00","forecast":0.48},{"timestamp":"2022-03-08 10:13:38.161695+00:00","forecast":0.48},{"timestamp":"2022-03-09 22:09:47.430130+00:00","forecast":0.48},{"timestamp":"2022-03-10 23:45:59.916794+00:00","forecast":0.48},{"timestamp":"2022-03-12 06:22:16.376469+00:00","forecast":0.48},{"timestamp":"2022-03-14 08:06:58.068297+00:00","forecast":0.48},{"timestamp":"2022-03-15 10:51:00.111796+00:00","forecast":0.48},{"timestamp":"2022-04-03 21:29:07.307955+00:00","forecast":0.48},{"timestamp":"2022-05-04 03:34:22.372416+00:00","forecast":0.48},{"timestamp":"2022-06-02 21:48:35.449619+00:00","forecast":0.48},{"timestamp":"2022-06-11 04:40:39.595740+00:00","forecast":0.48}],"avg_pred":0.4677272727,"median_pred":0.48,"majority_pred":0.48,"pred_taken":0.48,"acceptable_pred_lower_boundary":0.28,"acceptable_pred_upper_boundary":0.68,"context":"Entities:\n- Unemployment: The term refers to the percentage of the labor force that is without work but actively seeking employment. It is an important economic indicator of the health of a nation's economy.\n- Inflation rate: It is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising and, consequently, purchasing power is falling. It is also an important economic indicator of the health of a nation's economy.\n\nDates: None mentioned in the question.\n\nLocations: None mentioned in the question.\n\nBackground research:\n- Unemployment: Unemployment is a key measure of economic health. When unemployment is high, the economy is generally considered to be in a recession, and when it is low, the economy is considered to be healthy. The unemployment rate is calculated by dividing the number of unemployed individuals by the total number of individuals in the labor force. The labor force includes all individuals who are employed or actively seeking employment.\n- Inflation rate: Inflation is a measure of the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising. When inflation is high, the purchasing power of the currency decreases, leading to a decrease in economic growth. Inflation is usually measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which tracks the price changes of a basket of goods and services over time.\n\nRelationship between the terms:\nUnemployment and inflation are two important economic indicators that are often used to assess the health of an economy. High unemployment can lead to decreased consumer spending, which can lead to decreased economic growth and increased inflation. Conversely, high inflation can lead to increased unemployment as businesses may cut back on hiring and investment.\n\nRank of importance:\nBoth unemployment and inflation are important economic indicators, with unemployment being slightly more important in terms of forecasting economic growth and inflation being more important in terms of assessing the health of an economy.

This strategy involves strict lockdowns, travel restrictions, and aggressive testing and contact tracing measures to quickly identify and isolate new cases. The goal of this strategy is to reduce the number of infections to zero, rather than simply managing and mitigating the spread of the virus.\n\nHistorical background:\n- China's response to COVID-19: China was the first country to report cases of COVID-19 in December 2019. The Chinese government responded by implementing strict lockdowns and travel restrictions in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. These measures helped to contain the initial outbreak in China, and the country was able to successfully control subsequent waves of the virus through a combination of aggressive testing, contact tracing, and quarantine measures. China's zero-covid strategy has been credited with helping to reduce the number of infections and deaths in the country.\n\nImportant economic and societal considerations:\n- Economic impact: China's zero-covid strategy has had a significant impact on the country's economy, with strict lockdowns and travel restrictions leading to reduced economic activity and disruptions to global supply chains. The Chinese government has implemented various measures to support businesses and stimulate economic growth, but abandoning the zero-covid strategy could have implications for the country's economic recovery.\n- Societal impact: The zero-covid strategy has also had a significant impact on Chinese society, with people experiencing prolonged periods of isolation and limited social interaction. There have also been concerns about the mental health impacts of the pandemic and the government's response.\n\nRank of importance:\n- China: High importance, as it is the subject of the question.\n- Zero-Covid Strategy: High importance, as it is the main focus of the question and the approach that China has been using to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.\n- June 1, 2022: Medium importance, as it is a specific date mentioned in the question that implies a time constraint on China's decision.\n- Economic and societal considerations: Medium importance, as they are important factors to consider when analyzing China's potential decision to abandon their zero-covid strategy."},{"example_question":"Will the US experience a 4th wave of COVID before June 1, 2021?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will Charity Entrepreneurship launch a family planning charity as part of its 2021 incubation program?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will JHU CSSE's COVID-19 dashboard remain open and maintained through 2020-12-31?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will Bongbong Marcos win the 2022 Philippine Presidential Election?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will Louis C.K. release a stand-up comedy special before 2021?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the community prediction do better than the Metaculus prediction for the 2nd instalment of the Lightning round (LRT2)?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will EA Global London 2021 be cancelled, rescheduled, or moved online again?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the University of Pennsylvania send undergraduates back home Spring 2021?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will at least one SARS-CoV-2 vaccines be granted emergency use authorization by the U.S. FDA for children under 12 years old before 1 September 2021?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.35},{"example_question":"Will Princeton cancel in person classes in January 2022?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will Taipei enter Level 4 restrictions by May 31st?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0,"example_context":"Entities:\n- Taipei: Taipei is the capital city of Taiwan, located in the northern part of the island.

Low levels of unemployment typically corresponded with higher inflation, while high unemployment corresponded with lower inflation and even deflation. However, the relationship between unemployment and inflation has become less clear in recent years, with some economists arguing that other factors, such as productivity and technology, have become more important in determining inflation. While unemployment may still be a useful factor in forecasting inflation, it should not be relied upon as the sole indicator."}
{"question":"Will spending on US office construction be less than $77 Billion USD in 2022?","id":"M8334","background":"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on commercial real estate, particularly retail and hospitality locations, as well as urban office spaces. In April 2020, Gallup found that 69% of full-time employed americans were working from home. Some wonder whether this is the beginning of the end of major downtown office buildings, but Andra Ghent, associate professor of finance at UNC, predicts \"it\u2019s unlikely that increased technology adoption will affect prime office space in core downtown areas in major cities, where location brings important benefits through networking and access to skilled workers.\" In March 2020 US Spending on office construction and maintenance reached an all-time high of $95 Billion, and then declined over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns to $80 Billion in December 2020. Office construction has gone through similar cycles in the past, reaching a low of $34 Billion in February 2011 following the 2008 financial crisis. Will spending on US office construction be less than $77 Billion USD in 2022? This question will resolve positively if the average seasonally-adjusted annual office construction spending in 2022 is less than $77 Billion according to the US Census Bureau.

being questioned in the question, which is seventy-seven billion US dollars.\n\nHistorical background:\nThe construction industry in the United States has been an important sector of the economy for many years. The industry has experienced fluctuations in growth and activity due to various economic and societal factors. According to the US Census Bureau, the value of construction put in place in the US was approximately $1.29 trillion in 2020, with office construction accounting for a significant portion of that total. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruptions in the construction industry, including office construction, which may impact future spending in this area.\n\nImportant economic and societal considerations:\n- Economic growth: The level of economic growth in the US can impact the amount of spending on office construction. A strong economy may result in increased spending on construction projects, while a weak economy may lead to decreased spending.\n- Interest rates: Interest rates can affect the cost of borrowing money for construction projects, which can impact the amount of spending on office construction.\n- Demographic changes: Changes in the demographic makeup of the workforce, such as an increase in remote work or changes in office space needs, can impact the demand for office construction and therefore impact spending.\n- Environmental concerns: Green building practices and sustainability have become increasingly important considerations in the construction industry, which may impact the cost and amount of spending on office construction.\n\nRelationship between the terms:\nThe question is asking whether spending on US office construction will be less than $77 Billion USD in 2022.

{"question":"Will the IMF approve debt service relief for the US before 2025?","id":"M8460","background":"The US' national debt has grown significantly, particularly during the 2008 global financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. Concerns over a potential debt crisis have been voiced repeatedly, particularly during reoccurring legislative debates to raise the debt ceiling. Despite this, the US has had very low interest rates since 2010, both encouraging the US to continue borrowing at cheap rates, and signalling that lenders consider the US government to be a reliable and safe borrower. If this were to escalate into a criss, the US could be so far behind on its debt that the IMF would be called upon to forgive some of their debt. Notably, the IMF provided debt service for Greece in 2011 and for multiple Latin American Nations in the 1980s. Will the IMF approve debt service relief for the US before 2025? This question will resolve as Yes if the IMF executive board approves debt service relief on the US' debt any time between November 1, 2021 to January 1, 2025.","publish_time":1635634800000,"close_time":"2024-12-31 17:00:00+00:00","tags":["Economy \u2013 US"],"source_links":["https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/GFDEBTN\/","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States_debt_ceiling#Legislative_history","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/National_debt_of_the_United_States#Negative_real_interest_rates","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Greek_government-debt_crisis","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Latin_American_debt_crisis"],"prediction_count":42.0,"forecaster_count":21,"answer":null,"choices":["yes","no"],"status":"Active","qtype":"t\/f","crowd":[{"timestamp":"2021-10-31 03:09:51.702336+00:00","forecast":0.56},{"timestamp":"2021-10-31 03:23:23.784293+00:00","forecast":0.19},{"timestamp":"2021-10-31 07:51:39.463184+00:00","forecast":0.105},{"timestamp":"2021-10-31 08:28:35.451974+00:00","forecast":0.1},{"timestamp":"2021-10-31 16:41:25.609491+00:00","forecast":0.02},{"timestamp":"2021-10-31 22:34:15.104520+00:00","forecast":0.02},{"timestamp":"2021-11-01 17:46:02.075741+00:00","forecast":0.02},{"timestamp":"2021-11-02 00:57:08.800334+00:00","forecast":0.02},{"timestamp":"2021-11-02 08:16:43.663848+00:00","forecast":0.02},{"timestamp":"2021-11-02 10:42:01.110034+00:00","forecast":0.02},{"timestamp":"2021-11-02 18:19:28.338768+00:00","forecast":0.02},{"timestamp":"2021-11-02 19:26:32.650996+00:00","forecast":0.02},{"timestamp":"2021-11-02 20:08:37.783972+00:00","forecast":0.02},{"timestamp":"2021-11-04 01:46:58.045565+00:00","forecast":0.04},{"timestamp":"2021-11-04 20:59:22.047240+00:00","forecast":0.04},{"timestamp":"2021-12-07 00:46:56.587276+00:00","forecast":0.04},{"timestamp":"2021-12-30 20:03:26.495841+00:00","forecast":0.04},{"timestamp":"2021-12-30 22:25:46.271629+00:00","forecast":0.04},{"timestamp":"2021-12-31 03:55:20.596823+00:00","forecast":0.04},{"timestamp":"2022-01-04 05:26:05.262528+00:00","forecast":0.05},{"timestamp":"2022-01-05 22:47:49.818813+00:00","forecast":0.05},{"timestamp":"2022-01-09 11:10:55.593414+00:00","forecast":0.05},{"timestamp":"2022-01-11 03:47:42.858769+00:00","forecast":0.05},{"timestamp":"2022-02-14 14:39:27.277586+00:00","forecast":0.06},{"timestamp":"2022-02-19 06:02:20.998912+00:00","forecast":0.07},{"timestamp":"2022-02-22 11:58:12.329010+00:00","forecast":0.05},{"timestamp":"2022-02-24 21:50:46.788401+00:00","forecast":0.04},{"timestamp":"2022-02-28 02:44:57.016776+00:00","forecast":0.03},{"timestamp":"2022-03-08 18:54:28.362638+00:00","forecast":0.03},{"timestamp":"2022-03-19 23:53:11.792442+00:00","forecast":0.03},{"timestamp":"2022-04-03 21:27:35.673878+00:00","forecast":0.03},{"timestamp":"2022-05-04 03:32:01.348296+00:00","forecast":0.03},{"timestamp":"2022-05-08 21:37:56.923955+00:00","forecast":0.03},{"timestamp":"2022-05-11 08:54:27.344121+00:00","forecast":0.05},{"timestamp":"2022-06-03 04:03:36.537813+00:00","forecast":0.03},{"timestamp":"2022-06-05 06:57:42.841174+00:00","forecast":0.03},{"timestamp":"2022-06-11 04:11:56.452423+00:00","forecast":0.04},{"timestamp":"2022-06-12 15:49:46.710849+00:00","forecast":0.06},{"timestamp":"2022-06-12 23:02:12.722424+00:00","forecast":0.09},{"timestamp":"2022-06-13 09:14:59.080502+00:00","forecast":0.09},{"timestamp":"2022-06-14 00:45:48.091868+00:00","forecast":0.09},{"timestamp":"2022-06-14 02:08:12.277627+00:00","forecast":0.09}],"avg_pred":0.0605952381,"median_pred":0.04,"majority_pred":0.02,"pred_taken":0.02,"acceptable_pred_lower_boundary":-0.18,"acceptable_pred_upper_boundary":0.22,"context":"Entities:\n- IMF (International Monetary Fund): an international organization that aims to promote international monetary cooperation, exchange stability, and orderly exchange arrangements, as well as to facilitate the balanced growth of international trade and provide resources to help members in need.\n- US (United States): a country located in North America, known for its economic and political influence on the world stage.\n\nDates:\n- Before 2025: the time frame within which the question is asking if the IMF will approve debt service relief for the US.\n\nSpecial Terms:\n- Debt service relief: a measure taken by a creditor to reduce or suspend payments of interest and principal on a debt owed by a debtor.\n- Approval: the act of officially agreeing to or accepting a proposal, request, or agreement.\n- Ranking: the act of assigning a level of importance or priority to something.\n\nHistorical Background:\nThe IMF was established in 1944 with the goal of promoting international monetary cooperation and economic growth. The US is a founding member of the organization and has played a significant role in its operations since its inception. In recent years, the US has been facing mounting levels of debt, with its national debt surpassing $28 trillion in 2021. This has led to speculation about whether the US will be able to continue servicing its debt obligations.\n\nEconomic and Societal Considerations:\nThe approval of debt service relief by the IMF for the US would have significant economic and societal implications. It could potentially free up resources for the US government to allocate towards other priorities, such as infrastructure, education, and healthcare. However, it could also signal to other countries that the US is not able to manage its debt, which could lead to a loss of confidence in the US economy and financial markets.\n\nRelationship between Terms:\nThe question is asking whether the IMF will approve debt service relief for the US before 2025.

{"question":"Will median wages be higher for women than for men in the United States in 2050?","id":"M8555","background":"Many studies have been attempted to measure the gender pay gap in the US. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics found median women's wages to be about 81% of men's. Some of this difference can be attributed to confounding variables (such as differences in types of occupation), though the unexplained remaining gap could be attributed to discrimination. Neuroscientist and fiction author Erik Hoel wrote the following about women in the year 2050 in a blog post published August 25, 2021 ...while women\u2019s salaries are not as high on average as men\u2019s now, this has already switched in urban areas, which is generally a predictive indicator, and therefore women\u2019s wages in the workplace will indeed be greater than men in terms of their salaries by 2050. Will median wages be higher for women than for men in the United States in 2050? This question resolves positively if the median usual weekly real earnings for wage and salary workers age 16 and over are higher for women than men in the fourth quarter of 2050, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. The data since 1979 is available in this FRED chart for men and women. If BLS stops publishing the relevant economic data, other credible data that provides a similar comparison between the median wages of adult men and women may be used. If FRED no longer distinguishes data for men and women or definitions have changed, any data that compares wages on the basis of either sex at birth or current sex or gender identity as may be used for resolution. Where different estimates would result in a different resolution, Metaculus Admins may resolve according to the most high-quality data or resolve ambiguously at their discretion.","publish_time":1642626000000,"close_time":"2040-12-31 19:30:00+00:00","tags":["Social issues","Series -- Erik Hoel 2050","Human Sciences \u2013 Demography","Economy \u2013 US"],"source_links":["https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gender_pay_gap_in_the_United_States","https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/graph\/?g=IF6j","https:\/\/erikhoel.substack.com\/p\/futurists-have-their-heads-in-the","https:\/\/www.pewtrusts.org\/en\/research-and-analysis\/blogs\/stateline\/2018\/03\/14\/a-different-kind-of-gender-gap-seven-places-where-women-earn-more-than-men","http:\/\/www.bls.gov\/cps\/earnings.htm","https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/graph\/?g=IF6j"],"prediction_count":38.0,"forecaster_count":22,"answer":null,"choices":["yes","no"],"status":"Active","qtype":"t\/f","crowd":[{"timestamp":"2022-01-19 22:43:47.757336+00:00","forecast":0.35},{"timestamp":"2022-01-20 02:49:41.452085+00:00","forecast":0.44},{"timestamp":"2022-01-20 07:45:21.808016+00:00","forecast":0.53},{"timestamp":"2022-01-20 11:16:11.418327+00:00","forecast":0.39},{"timestamp":"2022-01-20 17:18:09.075225+00:00","forecast":0.46},{"timestamp":"2022-01-20 19:30:25.665131+00:00","forecast":0.5},{"timestamp":"2022-01-20 22:00:44.518425+00:00","forecast":0.46},{"timestamp":"2022-01-21 00:03:58.127154+00:00","forecast":0.46},{"timestamp":"2022-01-21 06:31:09.745388+00:00","forecast":0.5},{"timestamp":"2022-01-21 07:02:07.196432+00:00","forecast":0.46},{"timestamp":"2022-01-23 06:03:44.259717+00:00","forecast":0.39},{"timestamp":"2022-01-23 08:04:07.271605+00:00","forecast":0.39},{"timestamp":"2022-01-24 02:44:30.226408+00:00","forecast":0.39},{"timestamp":"2022-01-24 21:41:15.025834+00:00","forecast":0.39},{"timestamp":"2022-01-25 18:21:52.300328+00:00","forecast":0.39},{"timestamp":"2022-01-25 18:21:55.225347+00:00","forecast":0.39},{"timestamp":"2022-01-27 03:29:37.230152+00:00","forecast":0.47},{"timestamp":"2022-01-27 03:29:47.987669+00:00","forecast":0.47},{"timestamp":"2022-01-27 08:04:18.532336+00:00","forecast":0.47},{"timestamp":"2022-01-27 11:15:52.067599+00:00","forecast":0.47},{"timestamp":"2022-01-28 18:26:54.628392+00:00","forecast":0.47},{"timestamp":"2022-01-30 04:12:10.646719+00:00","forecast":0.47},{"timestamp":"2022-01-30 05:11:40.987463+00:00","forecast":0.39},{"timestamp":"2022-01-30 08:04:25.409151+00:00","forecast":0.39},{"timestamp":"2022-01-31 04:59:17.180586+00:00","forecast":0.39},{"timestamp":"2022-01-31 04:59:29.641706+00:00","forecast":0.39},{"timestamp":"2022-03-02 01:10:36.506135+00:00","forecast":0.39},{"timestamp":"2022-03-05 09:40:00.166859+00:00","forecast":0.38},{"timestamp":"2022-03-05 16:04:32.150876+00:00","forecast":0.38},{"timestamp":"2022-04-01 15:47:06.092846+00:00","forecast":0.37},{"timestamp":"2022-04-01 16:04:58.531045+00:00","forecast":0.37},{"timestamp":"2022-05-04 03:36:05.076058+00:00","forecast":0.37},{"timestamp":"2022-05-04 22:11:47.911091+00:00","forecast":0.37},{"timestamp":"2022-05-18 13:13:54.465739+00:00","forecast":0.37},{"timestamp":"2022-06-07 18:14:02.799458+00:00","forecast":0.37},{"timestamp":"2022-06-11 05:11:19.863839+00:00","forecast":0.37},{"timestamp":"2022-06-12 05:15:02.362481+00:00","forecast":0.37},{"timestamp":"2022-06-14 02:07:30.597602+00:00","forecast":0.37}],"avg_pred":0.4144736842,"median_pred":0.39,"majority_pred":0.39,"pred_taken":0.39,"acceptable_pred_lower_boundary":0.19,"acceptable_pred_upper_boundary":0.59,"context":"Entities:\n- Median Wages: Median wages refer to the middle point of all wages earned by workers in a specific occupation or industry.

{"question":"Will Brian Riedl win his bet with Alan Cole regarding the interest rate paid on the federal debt?","id":"M8572","background":"Brian Riedl is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a think tank which describes its mission as follows ...to develop and disseminate new ideas that foster greater economic choice and individual responsibility. Alan Cole blogs about the economy at Full Stack Economics and is a former senior economist with the Joint Economic Committee of the US Congress where he advised Senator Mike Lee (R-UT). On November 9, 2021, Brian Riedl proposed the following bet I'm willing to bet you that the average interest rate paid on the federal debt exceeds 4.6% at some point within 30 years (CBO assumes it gradually rises to 4.6% by 2051). Alan Cole accepted. They agreed to resolve the bet based on the average interest rate as currently calculated by CBO in its economical historical data. In The 2021 Long-Term Budget Outlook published by the CBO in March of 2021, the CBO projects ...the average interest rate on federal debt initially decreases from 1.4 percent in 2021 to 1.2 percent in 2024 and then increases to 4.6 percent by 2051.

Riedl bet that the interest rate would rise above 3.7% by the end of 2021, while Cole bet that it would not. The bet was made due to concerns about the growing federal debt and its impact on the economy.\n\nInterest rates on the federal debt are influenced by various economic factors, including inflation, economic growth, and monetary policy. The Federal Reserve has the power to set short-term interest rates, while long-term rates are influenced by market forces.\n\nThe federal debt has been a concern for policymakers due to its potential impact on the economy. High levels of debt can lead to higher interest rates, which can make it more difficult for the government to borrow money and can also lead to higher borrowing costs for businesses and consumers.\n\nImportance Ranking:\n1. Interest rate - The interest rate is the main focus of the question and is therefore the most important term.\n2. Brian Riedl and Alan Cole - Their positions and the bet they made are important in understanding the background of the question.\n3.

{"question":"By 2025, will a majority of US Intelligence Community organizations support a lab leak hypothesis for SARS-CoV-2 over a natural origin hypothesis?","id":"M8605","background":"A declassified assessment by the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC) on the origins of SARS-CoV-2 was made available on 2021-10-29 and is based on information available through August 2021. Notably, it found wide agreement among the U.S. IC's 18 organizations on the following: \"SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, probably emerged and infected humans through an initial small-scale exposure that occurred no later than November 2019 with the first known cluster of COVID-19 cases arising in Wuhan, China in December 2019.\" \"We judge the virus was not developed as a biological weapon\" \"Most agencies also assess with low confidence that SARS-CoV-2 probably was not genetically engineered; however, two agencies believe there was not sufficient evidence to make an assessment either way.\" \"China\u2019s officials did not have foreknowledge of the virus before the initial outbreak of COVID-19 emerged\" However, while \"all agencies assess that two hypotheses are plausible: natural exposure to an infected animal and a laboratory-associated incident,\" the IC \"remains divided on the most likely origin of COVID-19\": \"Four IC elements and the National Intelligence Council assess with low confidence that the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection was most likely caused by natural exposure to an animal infected with it or a close progenitor virus\" \"One IC element assesses with moderate confidence that the first human infection with SARS-CoV-2 most likely was the result of a laboratory-associated incident, probably involving experimentation, animal handling, or sampling by the Wuhan Institute of Virology.\" \"Analysts at three IC elements remain unable to coalesce around either explanation without additional information\" The declassified report states that more information on the earliest cases may \"alter our evaluation of hypotheses\" and that, in the past, the \"identification of animal sources has taken years.\" By 2025, will a majority of US Intelligence Community organizations support a lab leak hypothesis for SARS-CoV-2 over a natural origin hypothesis? This question will resolves as Yes if, at any time between November 1, 2021 to January 1, 2025, a majority of U.S. IC organizations that favor either the natural origin or lab leak hypotheses are said to favor the explanation that SARS-CoV-2 originated in a lab in Hubei. This means that only the IC organizations that expressly favor one explanation over the other will be considered for the purposes of this question. For example, in the most recent declassified assessment, four organizations favor the natural origin hypothesis (\"Four IC elements and the National Intelligence Council assess with low confidence that the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection was most likely caused by natural exposure\"), one IC organization favors the lab origin hypothesis (\"One IC element assesses with moderate confidence that the first human infection with SARS-CoV-2 most likely was the result of a laboratory-associated incident\"), and three organizations do not favor either hypothesis (\"Analysts at three IC elements remain unable to coalesce around either explanation\"). So in this case, there appear to be five IC organizations that favor one explanation or the other \u2014 four favor the natural origin hypothesis, and one favors the lab origin hypothesis. Since in this case 1\/5 does not constitute a majority (>50%) of U.S. IC organizations that express support for either hypothesis, this would resolve negatively. Note that probabilistic statements do not have to be made to constitute an IC organization expressing support for one of two hypotheses. Vague verbiage \u2014 e.g. \"moderate confidence that SARS-CoV-2 most likely resulted from\" \u2014 would be sufficient to be counted as support for one hypothesis or the other so long as it is clear that one hypothesis is favored over the other. This question will preferentially resolve on the basis of an updated declassified assessment by the U.S. Intelligence Community. However, this can also resolve on the basis of at least three credible media reports indicating that a majority of IC organizations favor one explanation over the other.

US Intelligence Community organizations: Refers to the various agencies and departments responsible for intelligence gathering and analysis in the United States, including the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), National Security Agency (NSA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and others.\n- Lab leak hypothesis: The theory that the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic originated from a laboratory, rather than a natural source such as bats.\n- Natural origin hypothesis: The theory that the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic originated from a natural source, such as bats.\n\nDates:\n- 2025: The year by which the question posits that a majority of US Intelligence Community organizations will support one hypothesis over the other.\n\nBackground:\n- The COVID-19 pandemic began in late 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since spread worldwide, resulting in millions of deaths and significant economic and societal impacts.\n- The origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is still a matter of debate and investigation, with the lab leak hypothesis gaining traction in recent months as a potential explanation.\n- The US Intelligence Community has been involved in investigating the origin of the virus, with a report commissioned by President Biden in May 2021 asking for a review of intelligence regarding the matter.\n- The lab leak hypothesis has been controversial, with some scientists and politicians accusing China of covering up the origins of the virus and potentially allowing it to escape from a laboratory in Wuhan.\n\nEconomic and societal considerations:\n- The origin of the virus has significant economic and societal implications, as it could impact the way governments and individuals respond to the pandemic and potentially affect international relations.\n- If the lab leak hypothesis is proven true, it could have implications for the regulation and safety of laboratories worldwide, as well as potentially leading to legal action or reparations for damages caused by the pandemic.\n\nRelationship between terms:\n- The lab leak and natural origin hypotheses are two competing theories about the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n- The US Intelligence Community organizations are involved in investigating the origin of the virus and determining which hypothesis is more likely to be true.\n- The question posits that by 2025, a majority of these organizations will support the lab leak hypothesis over the natural origin hypothesis.\n\nImportance ranking:\n- Lab leak hypothesis: High, as it is the focus of the question and a controversial and important topic in current events.\n- US Intelligence Community organizations: High, as they are the entities responsible for investigating the origin of the virus and determining which hypothesis is more likely to be true.\n- Natural origin hypothesis: Medium, as it is one of the two competing theories about the origin of the virus and will likely be considered in the investigation.\n- 2025: Low, as it is simply the year by which the question posits that a majority of US Intelligence Community organizations will support one hypothesis over the other, and does not have any inherent significance beyond that.","examples":[{"example_question":"Will the 7-day moving average of current confirmed COVID-19 hospitalizations in Virginia cross 1,000

{"question":"Will the peak 7-day average of COVID-19 cases OR CLI in Virginia during a summer exceed the same peak during the preceding winter for any year before 1 November 2026?","id":"M8725","background":"Note: this is a long term question which will not count toward the tournament leaderboard. See the tournament page for details. VDH tracks the number of new COVID-19 cases by date of symptom onset, which it currently updates on weekdays. VDH also tracks CLI visits as a broader measure of COVID-19-induced burden and as an alternative to directly tracking COVID-19 cases\/hospitalizations: \u201cmonitors ED visits to measure the number of patients seeking care for a COVID-like illness (CLI). Visits for CLI include those noting symptoms of fever + respiratory complaint, loss of taste or smell, those with a coronavirus or severe respiratory diagnosis, or visits that mention COVID-19 as the reason for visit. CLI visits do not include COVID-19 vaccination visits or visits with an influenza diagnosis. These data may not represent confirmed cases of COVID-19, but they can assist with understanding the burden on healthcare systems and the community.\u201d This question asks whether the peak 7-day average of COVID-19 cases or COVID-like illness visits during a summer (June, July, August) will exceed the previous winter\u2019s peak (December, January, February). This is important for seasonal planning and staffing purposes.

{"question":"Will the U.S. CDC classify Omicron as a variant of high consequence (VOHC) before 2023?","id":"M8752","background":"On 25 November, South Africa announced that it was tracking a new variant, B.1.1.529\/Omicron, and shared the following: New variant detected in South Africa (lineage B.1.1.529) with high number of mutations, which are concerning for predicted immune evasion and transmissibility B.1.1.529 genomes produced from samples collected 12-20 Nov from Gauteng, SA (n=77), Botswana (n=4) and Hong Kong (n=1, traveler from SA) B.1.1.529 can be detected by one particular PCR assay (before whole genome sequencing) Early signs from diagnostic laboratories that B.1.1.529 has rapidly increased in Gauteng and may already be present in most provinces Mutation profile predicted to give significant immune evasion and enhanced transmissibility See also these three assessments by the UK HSA, Belgian NRL, and WHO respectively. The U.S. CDC currently defines four classes of SARS-CoV-2 variants: variants being monitored, variants of interest, variants of concern, and variants of high consequence. Of these, variant of high consequence (VOHC) is the most severe classification. A VOHC is a variant that \u201chas clear evidence that prevention measures or medical countermeasures (MCMs) have significantly reduced effectiveness relative to previously circulating variants.\u201d Moreover, a VOHC might have the following attributes: Demonstrated failure of diagnostic test targets Evidence to suggest a significant reduction in vaccine effectiveness, a disproportionately high number of infections in vaccinated persons, or very low vaccine-induced protection against severe disease Significantly reduced susceptibility to multiple Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) or approved therapeutics More severe clinical disease and increased hospitalizations To date, no SARS-CoV-2 variant has been classified as a VOHC. Will the U.S. CDC classify Omicron as a variant of high consequence (VOHC) before 2023? This question will resolve positive if, before 2023, the Omicron variant is categorized under the \u201cVariant of High Consequence\u201d section on the CDC\u2019s SARS-CoV-2 Variant Classifications and Definitions page.

U.S. CDC: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is a national public health institute in the United States that is responsible for protecting public health and safety through the control and prevention of disease, injury, and disability.\n\n- Omicron: Omicron is a SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (VOC) that was first identified in South Africa in November 2021. It has a large number of mutations in the spike protein, which may affect its transmissibility, severity, and immune escape potential.\n\nTerms:\n- Variant of high consequence (VOHC): VOHC is a classification used by the CDC to describe a SARS-CoV-2 variant that has evidence of significantly reduced vaccine effectiveness, more severe disease, or increased transmission. VOHCs are considered to pose a substantial risk to public health.\n\n- 2023: 2023 is a year in the future when the CDC may or may not classify Omicron as a VOHC.\n\nRanking:\n- U.S. CDC: 5\/5, as it is the main organization responsible for monitoring and responding to infectious disease outbreaks in the United States.\n- Omicron: 5\/5, as it is the main subject of the question and has significant implications for public health.\n- Variant of high consequence (VOHC): 4\/5, as it is the classification that the question is asking about and is important for understanding the severity of a SARS-CoV-2 variant.\n- 2023: 2\/5, as it is simply a future date and does not have any inherent importance to the question beyond being a deadline for the CDC's decision.\n\nHistorical background:\nThe CDC has been monitoring the emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. It has established a classification system for variants based on their potential impact on public health, with VOHC being the highest level of concern. The CDC has not yet classified Omicron as a VOHC, but it is closely monitoring the situation and conducting studies to determine the variant's transmissibility, severity, and vaccine effectiveness.\n\nEconomic and societal considerations:\nThe classification of Omicron as a VOHC could have significant economic and societal implications, as it would likely lead to increased public health measures such as lockdowns, travel restrictions, and vaccine mandates. It could also impact global trade and travel, as countries may restrict or ban travel from areas with high levels of Omicron transmission. Additionally, the classification could affect public perception and confidence in the COVID-19 vaccines, as a VOHC classification may suggest that the vaccines are less effective against the variant.\n\nRelationships:\nThe question is asking about the relationship between Omicron and the VOHC classification by the CDC. The classification will depend on the available evidence regarding the variant's potential impact on public health, including its transmissibility, severity, and vaccine effectiveness. The decision will also be influenced by the CDC's risk assessment and communication strategies, as well as input from other public health agencies and experts. The timing of the decision is uncertain and will depend on the availability and quality of data on the variant.","examples":[{"example_question":"Will Trump transfer presidential power to VP Mike

{"question":"Will the US, UK, or EU authorize an Omicron-specific booster before 2023?","id":"M8754","background":"On 25 November, South Africa announced that it was tracking a new variant, B.1.1.529\/Omicron, and shared the following: New variant detected in South Africa (lineage B.1.1.529) with high number of mutations, which are concerning for predicted immune evasion and transmissibility B.1.1.529 genomes produced from samples collected 12-20 Nov from Gauteng, SA (n=77), Botswana (n=4) and Hong Kong (n=1, traveler from SA) B.1.1.529 can be detected by one particular PCR assay (before whole genome sequencing) Early signs from diagnostic laboratories that B.1.1.529 has rapidly increased in Gauteng and may already be present in most provinces Mutation profile predicted to give significant immune evasion and enhanced transmissibility See also these three assessments by the UK HSA, Belgian NRL, and WHO respectively. Some have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines may have to be updated to target the Omicron variant in particular, given that its unique constellation of mutations may result in lower vaccine- and infection-elicited antibody neutralization. Vaccine producers including Moderna, Pfizer\/BioNTech, Janssen, and Novavax have said they are testing their vaccines against the new variant. Moderna has announced it is advancing an Omicron-specific booster candidate. Will the US, UK, or EU authorize an Omicron-specific booster before 2023? This question will resolve on the basis of whether the U.S. FDA, UK MHRA, or EU EMA authorize an Omicron-specific booster before 2023. An Omicron-specific booster must be specially formulated to specifically target the genetic sequence of the Omicron variant. The booster dose formulation can also include formulations that target other variants (e.g., Delta) so long as the Omicron variant is specifically targeted as well. Multi-valent booster candidates, such those being developed by Moderna, would count toward positive resolution so long as they target at least 8 spike mutations that Omicron has accrued relative to the original Wuhan-Hu-1 sequence. In the case of Moderna, this would mean that: the mRNA-1273.211 multi-valent candidate that targets 4 of Omicron's spike mutations would not count toward positive resolution, while the mRNA-1273.213 multi-valent candidate that targets 8 of Omicron's spike mutations would count.

and Northern Ireland.\n- EU: The European Union, a political and economic union of 27 member states located primarily in Europe.\n- Omicron: A variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, first identified in South Africa in November 2021.\n\nDates:\n- 2023: The year in which the question asks if an Omicron-specific booster will be authorized.\n\nDefinitions:\n- Booster: An additional dose of a vaccine, given after the initial doses, to enhance or extend the protection provided by the vaccine.\n- Omicron: A variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that has numerous mutations, some of which are believed to affect its transmissibility and immune evasion.\n\nHistorical Background:\n- The COVID-19 pandemic began in late 2019 and has since resulted in numerous waves of infections and deaths worldwide.\n- Vaccines against COVID-19 have been developed and authorized for emergency use in many countries, including the US, UK, and EU.\n- Various variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus have emerged over time, with the Omicron variant being the most recent.\n\nEconomic Considerations:\n- The COVID-19 pandemic has had significant economic impacts, including widespread job loss, business closures, and supply chain disruptions.\n- The development and distribution of vaccines have been a major focus for governments and public health officials as a way to mitigate the economic impacts of the pandemic.\n\nSocietal Considerations:\n- The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on society, including changes to work, school, and socialization.\n- Vaccine hesitancy and misinformation have been significant challenges in the effort to vaccinate the population.\n\nRelationships:\n- The question asks whether the US, UK, or EU will authorize an Omicron-specific booster before 2023.\n- The authorization of a booster would likely depend on the prevalence and severity of the Omicron variant, as well as the effectiveness of existing vaccines against it.\n- The decision to authorize a booster could have significant economic and societal impacts, particularly if it affects the ability of individuals to work or travel.\n\nRanking:\n- Omicron: High importance, as it is the focus of the question.\n- Booster: High importance, as the question specifically asks about the authorization of a booster.\n- US, UK, and EU: High importance, as the question asks about the actions of these entities.\n- 2023: Moderate importance, as it is the timeframe in which the question asks about the authorization of a booster.","examples":[{"example_question":"Will variants of concerns thought to partially escape

{"question":"Will the Federal Reserve set a target policy rate that is negative by 2050?","id":"M8968","background":"Since the early 1980s, most central banks have communicated their operation of monetary policy by setting a policy nominal interest rate. For example, the Fed in the US communicates the stance of monetary policy through its target for the federal funds rate (FFR); the Bank of England communicates the stance of monetary policy through its direct control of the official bank rate. (This in contrast to e.g. Milton Friedman's famous proposal for a rule for the growth rate of the monetary base.) Since all interest rates in an economy are linked by arbitrage pressure, the Fed by controlling the FFR can affect more general interest rates facing consumers and businesses \u2013 such as interest rates on bank deposits. The consensus understanding of monetary policy is that by controlling the current and expected future path of these interest rates, central banks can influence economic activity: GDP, inflation, unemployment, and other metrics. However, it has long been believed that central banks cannot push their policy rates much below zero. This is because of a no-arbitrage relation with physical cash. By holding physical cash, you can guarantee yourself a 0% nominal return: if you have 100 dollars in cash in your wallet today, you can ensure that you'll have 100 nominal dollars in your wallet next year, therefore guaranteeing a 0% nominal return. Thus, if the central bank tried to set its policy rate to cause the nominal bank deposit rate to be (say) -20%, then most everyone would pull their money out of the banking system and hold cash instead, to obtain the higher interest rate. (This is essentially a form of Gresham's Law: central banks peg physical cash and bank reserves at a 1:1 rate; but the rate of return on the two need not be the same.) This zero lower bound (ZLB) on nominal interest rates however is not a hard limit: because of the costs and inconvenience of storing cash and preventing theft, individuals and firms are willing to accept a somewhat negative nominal interest rate. Indeed, in Europe, the policy rate has been slightly negative since 2014, and this has spilled over to interest rates facing households, such as mortgage rates in Denmark. In the United States, unlike the ECB in the Eurozone, the Fed has been unwilling to target a policy rate even modestly below zero. Various Fed officials have argued (among other things) that they lack the legal authority to do so; or that benefits would not be large enough to outweigh some perceived risks. A history of the Federal Funds rate can be found at FRED Will the Federal Reserve set a target policy rate that is negative by 2050? The question will resolve positively if, anytime between January 1, 2021 to January 1, 2050, the target policy rate set by the Federal Reserve is negative. This information is taken from (e.g.) the latest press release on the Federal Reserve\u2019s website.

The World Health Organization's COVAX initiative, a program aimed and global vaccine distribution, set an initial target to reach a 20% rate in every country by end of 2021, and later raised their target to 40%. \"We\u2019re now at a point of having more than a billion doses a month of vaccines being produced, but it\u2019s a slow trickle still to get to low-income countries and lower middle-income countries,\" said Dr Krishna Udayakumar, of the Duke Global Health Innovation Center in December 2021. Airfinity, a UK analytics company, estimated in November 2021 that 500 million vaccine doses had been stockpiled (largely in rich countries) overshooting the demand in their respective countries, and projected this excess stockpile would grow to 970 million doses by June 2022. Will any nation have less than 10% of their population vaccinated with at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine on December 31, 2022? This question will resolve positively if on December 31, 2022, any nation reports that less than 10% of their population has recieved at least one dose of any COVID-19 vaccine, according to Our World In Data. Nations which do not have any data (such as North Korea) may be excluded unless an alternative credible source is available. Resolution may be delayed for 2 months to account for delays in reporting data.","publish_time":1640584800000,"close_time":"2023-02-28 17:00:00+00:00","tags":["Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19)","Series

This strategy involves strict lockdowns, travel restrictions, and aggressive testing and contact tracing measures to quickly identify and isolate new cases. The goal of this strategy is to reduce the number of infections to zero, rather than simply managing and mitigating the spread of the virus.\n\nHistorical background:\n- China's response to COVID-19: China was the first country to report cases of COVID-19 in December 2019. The Chinese government responded by implementing strict lockdowns and travel restrictions in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. These measures helped to contain the initial outbreak in China, and the country was able to successfully control subsequent waves of the virus through a combination of aggressive testing, contact tracing, and quarantine measures. China's zero-covid strategy has been credited with helping to reduce the number of infections and deaths in the country.\n\nImportant economic and societal considerations:\n- Economic impact: China's zero-covid strategy has had a significant impact on the country's economy, with strict lockdowns and travel restrictions leading to reduced economic activity and disruptions to global supply chains. The Chinese government has implemented various measures to support businesses and stimulate economic growth, but abandoning the zero-covid strategy could have implications for the country's economic recovery.\n- Societal impact: The zero-covid strategy has also had a significant impact on Chinese society, with people experiencing prolonged periods of isolation and limited social interaction.

It includes measures such as school and business closures, restrictions on public gatherings, and limits on non-essential travel.\n- COVID-19: COVID-19 is a respiratory illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The pandemic has had significant impacts on global health, society, and the economy.\n\nHistorical Background:\n- Taiwan has been praised for its successful handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, with strict border controls, widespread mask usage, and effective contact tracing measures. However, the country has recently experienced a surge in cases, largely linked to an outbreak among airline pilots. As of May 18th, Taipei has been under Level 3 restrictions, which include limits on gatherings, closures of certain businesses, and enhanced social distancing measures.\n- Taiwan has also faced challenges in securing vaccine supplies, with a reliance on vaccine donations and limited access to global supplies due to geopolitical tensions.\n\nEconomic and Societal Considerations:\n- The implementation of Level 4 restrictions would likely have significant economic impacts, particularly for small businesses and workers in affected industries. There may also be broader societal impacts, such as increased mental health challenges and disruptions to education.\n- However, there are also potential economic and societal costs to not implementing strict measures to control the pandemic, such as prolonged disruptions to daily life and the economy.\n\nRelationships:\n- The question is asking whether Taipei will enter Level 4 restrictions by May 31st.

This strategy involves strict lockdowns, travel restrictions, and aggressive testing and contact tracing measures to quickly identify and isolate new cases. The goal of this strategy is to reduce the number of infections to zero, rather than simply managing and mitigating the spread of the virus.\n\nHistorical background:\n- China's response to COVID-19: China was the first country to report cases of COVID-19 in December 2019. The Chinese government responded by implementing strict lockdowns and travel restrictions in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. These measures helped to contain the initial outbreak in China, and the country was able to successfully control subsequent waves of the virus through a combination of aggressive testing, contact tracing, and quarantine measures. China's zero-covid strategy has been credited with helping to reduce the number of infections and deaths in the country.\n\nImportant economic and societal considerations:\n- Economic impact: China's zero-covid strategy has had a significant impact on the country's economy, with strict lockdowns and travel restrictions leading to reduced economic activity and disruptions to global supply chains. The Chinese government has implemented various measures to support businesses and stimulate economic growth, but abandoning the zero-covid strategy could have implications for the country's economic recovery.\n- Societal impact: The zero-covid strategy has also had a significant impact on Chinese society, with people experiencing prolonged periods of isolation and limited social interaction. There have also been concerns about the mental health impacts of the pandemic and the government's response.\n\nRank of importance:\n- China: High importance, as it is the subject of the question.\n- Zero-Covid Strategy: High importance, as it is the main focus of the question and the approach that China has been using to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.\n- June 1, 2022: Medium importance, as it is a specific date mentioned in the question that implies a time constraint on China's decision.\n- Economic and societal considerations: Medium importance, as they are important factors to consider when analyzing China's potential decision to abandon their zero-covid strategy."},"lowest_uncertainty":0.0,"highest_uncertainty":0.45,"average_uncertainty":0.044,"external_context":"As of September 2021, many countries are still struggling to vaccinate their populations due to various reasons such as vaccine hesitancy, lack of access to vaccines, and logistical challenges.

{"question":"Will Holden win his Bet with Zvi about Omicron, conditional on one of them winning?","id":"M9119","background":"Related Question on Metaculus: Will Holden's Bet with Zvi about Omicron resolve ambiguously? On December 22, 2021 Holden Karnofsky published Bet with Zvi about Omicron on his Cold Takes blog: Zvi Mowshowitz and I have agreed to the following bet: If at least 75% of the USA COVID-19 cases between 1\/1\/22 and 2\/28\/23 (inclusive) occur between 1\/1\/22 and 2\/28\/22 (inclusive), I pay Zvi $40. Otherwise, Zvi pays me $60. This bet is intended to apply to Omicron and earlier strains, and it will be a \u201cpush\u201d if a post-Omicron strain \u201cmuddies the waters\u201d in the following sense: counting cases from the new strain would cause me to win, and not counting them would cause Zvi to win. We'll use Wikipedia for total COVID-19 cases and this CDC data for variant information. Each of us has the option to appeal to a third party (whom we've agreed on) to perform an adjustment for undertesting. The concept this is trying to capture is that Zvi thinks there\u2019s a 70% chance of the following: \u201cOmicron will blow through the US by 3\/1\/2022, leading to herd immunity and something like the \u2018end\u2019 of the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d I think there\u2019s only a 50% chance of this (and I would\u2019ve had a lower probability before learning that Zvi thinks it). We bet at 60%. Will Holden win his Bet with Zvi about Omicron, conditional on one of them winning? This question will resolve positively if Holden wins the above bet with Zvi, according to Holden's and Zvi's public agreement to resolve the bet. Resolution is positive if Holden wins, negative if Zvi wins, and ambiguous if they declare the bet is a \"push\".

entire world, with varying levels of severity in different countries and regions\n- Vaccine distribution and administration varies by country and region\n\nOther terms:\n- Second dose: for COVID-19 vaccines that require two doses, the second dose is typically administered a few weeks after the first dose\n- Delaying: administering the second dose later than the recommended interval between doses\n\nDefinitions:\n- SARS-CoV2 is a highly infectious virus that causes respiratory illness and can lead to severe complications and death in some cases.\n- Vaccines work by stimulating the immune system to recognize and fight off a specific pathogen, in this case, SARS-CoV2.\n\nHistorical background:\n- The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on global health and the economy, with millions of deaths and significant disruptions to daily life.\n- Vaccines have been developed and deployed at an unprecedented pace in response to the pandemic, with several different types of vaccines approved for emergency use around the world.\n\nImportant economic or societal considerations:\n- The COVID-19 pandemic has had significant economic impacts, with many businesses and industries struggling due to lockdowns and reduced consumer activity.\n- Vaccine distribution and administration can be challenging, particularly in areas with limited resources or infrastructure.\n\nRelationships:\n- Delaying the second dose of a vaccine could potentially increase the number of people who receive at least one dose, which could provide some level of protection against the virus.\n- However, it is unclear whether delaying the second dose would have a significant impact on overall mortality rates or other health outcomes.\n- The decision to delay the second

{"question":"Will Holden's Bet with Zvi about Omicron resolve ambiguously?","id":"M9120","background":"Related Question on Metaculus: Will Holden win his Bet with Zvi about Omicron, conditional on one of them winning? On December 22, 2021 Holden Karnofsky published Bet with Zvi about Omicron on his Cold Takes blog: Zvi Mowshowitz and I have agreed to the following bet: If at least 75% of the USA COVID-19 cases between 1\/1\/22 and 2\/28\/23 (inclusive) occur between 1\/1\/22 and 2\/28\/22 (inclusive), I pay Zvi $40. Otherwise, Zvi pays me $60. This bet is intended to apply to Omicron and earlier strains, and it will be a \u201cpush\u201d if a post-Omicron strain \u201cmuddies the waters\u201d in the following sense: counting cases from the new strain would cause me to win, and not counting them would cause Zvi to win. We'll use Wikipedia for total COVID-19 cases and this CDC data for variant information. Each of us has the option to appeal to a third party (whom we've agreed on) to perform an adjustment for undertesting. The concept this is trying to capture is that Zvi thinks there\u2019s a 70% chance of the following: \u201cOmicron will blow through the US by 3\/1\/2022, leading to herd immunity and something like the \u2018end\u2019 of the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d I think there\u2019s only a 50% chance of this (and I would\u2019ve had a lower probability before learning that Zvi thinks it). We bet at 60%. Will Holden's Bet with Zvi about Omicron resolve ambiguously? This question will resolve positively if Zvi and Holden's Bet about Omicron is not won by either Zvi or Holden, by mutual agreement between the two parties. That is, if the bet is called off, if the \u201cpush\u201d clause on post-Omicron strain(s) \u201cmuddying the waters\u201d is triggered, or there is not agreement between Zvi and Holden about the winner of the bet, then this question will resolve positively. If the bet has not been publicly resolved by September 1, 2023, this question will resolve positively.","publish_time":1641708000000,"close_time":"2023-01-08 05:59:00+00:00","tags":["Novel Coronavirus

{"question":"Will the next SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern originate in an low-vaccination nation?","id":"M9122","background":"The World Health Organization has (as of January 2022) identified several variants of SARS-CoV-2, 5 of which are designated as variants of concern. This designation indicates that the variant is more serious than previous variants of the virus, in that it is more transmissible, or evades current vaccinations or treatments. According to the WHO, 4 of the variants of concern emerged before vaccinations were available or widely deployed. Around 25-28% of South Africans had recieved at least 1 dose of a COVID vaccine at the time the omicron variant was identified there, while the global average vaccination share was around 50%. Dr. William Schaffner from the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center said to CNN in July 2021 \"Unvaccinated people are potential variant factories [...] The more unvaccinated people there are, the more opportunities for the virus to multiply [...] When it does, it mutates, and it could throw off a variant mutation that is even more serious down the road.\" Dr. Amesh Adalja, from the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security said to Poynter in August 2021, \"The delta variant emerged in a largely unvaccinated country [...] The more the virus spreads, the more chance there is for variants to emerge.\" Will the next SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern originate in an low-vaccination nation? This question will resolve positively if the next variant of concern originates from a country with a lower share of the population vaccinated than the global average. This question will use the WHO to determine the country of origin. If, like for omicron, they only list \"multiple countries\", we will consult cov-lineages, or wait for a epidemiological consensus to emerge. A country will be considered a \"low-vaccination nation\" if Our World in Data shows the share of population who have recieved at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine is lower than the global average during the period when the variant is estimated to have emerged. This question will resolve as ambiguous if there is no new variant of concern between January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2024.","publish_time":1642312800000,"close_time":"2024-01-01 05:00:00+00:00","tags":["Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19)","Effective Altruism"],"source_links":["https:\/\/www.who.int\/en\/activities\/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants\/","https:\/\/ourworldindata.org\/explorers\/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&time=2020-03-01..latest&facet=none&pickerSort=asc&pickerMetric=location&Metric=People+vaccinated&Interval=Cumulative&Relative+to+Population=true&Color+by+test+positivity=false&country=~ZAF","https:\/\/slatestarcodex.com\/2018\/02\/15\/five-more-years\/","https:\/\/www.who.int\/en\/activities\/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants\/","https:\/\/ourworldindata.org\/explorers\/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&time=2020-03-01..latest&facet=none&pickerSort=asc&pickerMetric=location&Metric=People+vaccinated&Interval=Cumulative&Relative+to+Population=true&Color+by+test+positivity=false&country=~OWID_WRL","https:\/\/www.who.int\/en\/activities\/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants\/","https:\/\/cov-lineages.org\/lineage_list.html","https:\/\/ourworldindata.org\/covid-vaccinations"],"prediction_count":34.0,"forecaster_count":17,"answer":null,"choices":["yes","no"],"status":"Active","qtype":"t\/f","crowd":[{"timestamp":"2022-01-16 12:43:21.450391+00:00","forecast":0.63},{"timestamp":"2022-01-16 16:04:02.964151+00:00","forecast":0.63},{"timestamp":"2022-01-16 18:24:57.866539+00:00","forecast":0.63},{"timestamp":"2022-01-16 18:31:05.457981+00:00","forecast":0.65},{"timestamp":"2022-01-16 19:44:35.029105+00:00","forecast":0.63},{"timestamp":"2022-01-18 05:00:28.397215+00:00","forecast":0.63},{"timestamp":"2022-01-18 07:38:44.488915+00:00","forecast":0.63},{"timestamp":"2022-01-18 15:28:22.454686+00:00","forecast":0.61},{"timestamp":"2022-01-18 16:03:58.909476+00:00","forecast":0.61},{"timestamp":"2022-01-18 22:59:12.220785+00:00","forecast":0.61},{"timestamp":"2022-01-19 23:56:29.484635+00:00","forecast":0.52},{"timestamp":"2022-01-20 00:04:05.534999+00:00","forecast":0.52},{"timestamp":"2022-01-20 01:31:12.177122+00:00","forecast":0.52},{"timestamp":"2022-01-20 05:16:42.979599+00:00","forecast":0.53},{"timestamp":"2022-01-20 08:03:52.354505+00:00","forecast":0.53},{"timestamp":"2022-01-20 10:10:52.961034+00:00","forecast":0.53},{"timestamp":"2022-01-21 00:28:29.470854+00:00","forecast":0.53},{"timestamp":"2022-01-23 03:59:50.840251+00:00","forecast":0.53},{"timestamp":"2022-03-02 01:13:13.385315+00:00","forecast":0.53},{"timestamp":"2022-03-08 02:55:17.788810+00:00","forecast":0.53},{"timestamp":"2022-03-14 16:06:12.084266+00:00","forecast":0.52},{"timestamp":"2022-03-15 00:05:00.055152+00:00","forecast":0.52},{"timestamp":"2022-03-15 10:49:35.800894+00:00","forecast":0.52},{"timestamp":"2022-03-17 00:56:22.971767+00:00","forecast":0.52},{"timestamp":"2022-03-24 02:46:29.511067+00:00","forecast":0.52},{"timestamp":"2022-03-27 22:48:33.003187+00:00","forecast":0.52},{"timestamp":"2022-03-28 09:06:28.341052+00:00","forecast":0.52},{"timestamp":"2022-04-03 21:28:21.141243+00:00","forecast":0.52},{"timestamp":"2022-05-04 03:31:40.025475+00:00","forecast":0.52},{"timestamp":"2022-05-11 05:45:09.432933+00:00","forecast":0.52},{"timestamp":"2022-06-08 07:33:07.489678+00:00","forecast":0.52},{"timestamp":"2022-06-12 05:15:09.259090+00:00","forecast":0.52},{"timestamp":"2022-06-12 22:56:45.511661+00:00","forecast":0.52},{"timestamp":"2022-06-14 02:07:34.942670+00:00","forecast":0.52}],"avg_pred":0.5532352941,"median_pred":0.525,"majority_pred":0.52,"pred_taken":0.52,"acceptable_pred_lower_boundary":0.32,"acceptable_pred_upper_boundary":0.72,"context":"Entities:\n- SARS-CoV-2: a virus that causes COVID-19, first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019.\n- Variant of concern: a variant of SARS-CoV-2 that has been identified as potentially more transmissible, more virulent, or able to evade immunity.\n- Low-vaccination nation: a country with a low percentage of its population vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nHistorical background:\nSARS-CoV-2 has undergone multiple mutations since its emergence, resulting in the emergence of several variants of concern, such as Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta. These variants have been identified in different parts of the world and have varying degrees of transmissibility, virulence, and ability to evade immunity. The emergence of these variants has been attributed to various factors, including high transmission rates, prolonged infections, and selective pressure from host immune responses.\n\nBackground on important economic or societal considerations:\nLow-vaccination nations may face greater challenges in controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2 due to lower levels of immunity in their populations.

The city was the first in the nation to issue a shelter-in-place order in March 2020, and it has implemented various restrictions on businesses and activities since then to slow the spread of the virus.\n- Indoor dining has been a particular area of concern during the pandemic, as it involves people removing their masks and spending extended periods of time in close proximity to one another, which increases the risk of transmission.\n- San Francisco has allowed indoor dining to resume with limited capacity and other safety measures in place, but the city has also imposed temporary bans on indoor dining in the past when COVID-19 cases have surged.\n\nImportant economic and societal considerations:\n- Banning indoor dining would have significant economic impacts on San Francisco's restaurant industry, which has already been hard-hit by the pandemic. Many restaurants have struggled to survive under the various restrictions and closures, and a ban on indoor dining could lead to more closures and job losses.\n- However, public health officials argue that such a ban may be necessary to slow the spread of COVID-19 and prevent more severe restrictions or lockdowns in the future.\n\nRelationship between terms:\n- San Francisco has the authority to issue health orders, which can include restrictions on activities like indoor dining.\n- The question is asking whether San Francisco will issue a health order banning all restaurant indoor dining during a specific time period.\n\nRank of importance:\n1. Health order: The issuance or non-issuance of a health order banning indoor dining is central to the question.\n2. Restaurant: The potential ban would have a significant impact on San Francisco's restaurant industry.\n3.

{"question":"Does Omicron have a shorter generation interval than Delta?","id":"M9487","background":"The generation interval is the time taken from the moment a person gets infected to the moment they infect a second person. On a population level, and as each individual typically transmits to multiple people, this forms a distribution. Along with the effective reproduction number (the average number of secondary infections from a single infected person), the generation interval distribution can be used to estimate the rate of transmission, forecast future infections, estimate the effectiveness of control measures, and potentially estimate the timing of an outbreak's peak and its final size. If two infectious diseases have the same reproduction number but one has a shorter generation interval then case numbers for that disease will rise and fall more quickly than for a disease with longer generation intervals. Similarly, if it is wrongly assumed that two diseases have the same generation interval when one is actually shorter then estimates of the reproduction number will be biased upwards. This may result in poor quality forecasts and impact the policy interventions implemented. Estimation of the generation interval is complex as both it and the effective reproduction number may change over time, across locations, and within subpopulations. We can think of the generation interval as being composed of both an individual's infectiousness over time and their contacts with others. Both of these are likely to differ due to demographic factors (such as age) with an individual's infectiousness likely also being altered by the effectiveness of their immune system and characteristics of the disease itself. The number, and type, of contacts for infected individuals, are also likely to vary over time and this can be impacted by mitigation efforts leading to reductions in the estimated generation interval (such as contact tracing). Finally, realised generation intervals may be dependent on the transmissibility of a disease with more transmissible diseases more rapidly depleting their local networks (such as households), and local (or global) high prevalence leading to an observed reduction due to competition effects between infectors. There are several transmission distributions that are related to the generation time including the serial interval (which is the time between the onset of symptoms for an infector and an infectee) , and the test-to-test distribution (which similarly is the interval between the case report of an infector and an infectee). These distributions may be used as a proxy for the generation time due to the difficulty in estimating the generation time. However, both of these measures are subject to a range of additional biases especially for pathogens that can transmit before the onset of symptoms, such as COVID-19. Does Omicron have a shorter generation interval than Delta? Will 3, or more, of the 5 most cited studies (available on the 1st of January 2023 that refer to the generation time\/interval of Omicron in the title as returned by a Google Scholar search for generation, time or interval, and Omicron) which estimate the generation interval or a transmission distribution proxy (such as the serial interval, or the test-to-test distribution) conclude (if no conclusion is made a study will be discarded and the next most cited study included) that the mean intrinsic (or realised if not distinguished) generation interval of Omicron is shorter than that of Delta? If fewer than 5 studies are found then the majority conclusion from these studies will be used.

{"question":"Will there be a Tau variant of COVID by Tau Day (June 28, 2022)?","id":"M9591","background":"Tau (\u03c4) is proposed as a circle constant, the ratio of a circle's circumference by its radius; its value, 6.283185..., is twice that of the most commonly used constant, \u03c0. In honor of half-tau, March 14 (3\/14 in American notation) is noted as Pi Day by various overlapping groups such as mathematicians, nerds, geeks and people who frequent prediction aggregation\/tracking websites. Some even more delightfully pedantic geeks, who contend that pi is wrong and want a pretext to eat twice as much pie, propose tau day as a celebration on June 28 (6\/28). Tau is also a Greek letter coming after \u03bf, \u03c0, \u03c1, \u03c3, which suggests it could be the name of a future named variant of SARS-COV-2 declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) - although two letters, \u03bd and \u03be, have been skipped so far. Will there be a Tau variant of COVID by Tau Day (June 28, 2022)?

The first identified variant of concern was the Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) in the UK in December 2020. Since then, other variants of concern have emerged, including the Beta variant (B.1.351) in South Africa, the Gamma variant (P.1) in Brazil, and the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) in India. The emergence of these variants has highlighted the need for continued surveillance and monitoring of the virus to identify any new variants that may emerge in the future.\n\nBackground on important economic or societal considerations:\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had significant economic and societal impacts globally. Governments have implemented various measures to control the spread of the virus, including lockdowns, travel restrictions, and social distancing guidelines. These measures have had a significant impact on businesses, with many struggling to survive. The pandemic has also highlighted existing inequalities in society, with some groups being disproportionately affected by the virus.\n\nRelationship between the terms:\nThe Tau variant is a hypothetical variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that may emerge in the future.

It is the world's most populous country, with a population of around 1.4 billion. China is the second-largest economy in the world after the United States, and it has been growing at a fast pace for the past few decades.\n- GDP: Gross Domestic Product is the total value of goods and services produced in a country over a specific period, usually one year. It is used as a measure of a country's economic performance and is often used to compare the size of economies.\n\nDates:\n- 2030: This is the year mentioned in the question as the deadline for China to overtake the US in terms of GDP. It is approximately ten years from now.\n\nRank of importance:\n- China: 5\/5\n- GDP: 5\/5\n- 2030: 4\/5\n\nHistorical background:\nChina's economic growth began in the late 1970s when the country started opening up to foreign investment and trade. Since then, China has experienced rapid economic growth, averaging around 10% per year for several decades. This growth has been driven by various factors, including a large labor force, government policies promoting investment and exports, and a shift towards a market-oriented economy.\n\nThe US, on the other hand, has been the world's largest economy for several decades. Its economic growth has been driven by factors such as a highly educated workforce, technological innovation, and a strong consumer market.\n\nBackground on important economic or societal considerations:\nThe question of whether China's GDP will overtake the US before 2030 has significant economic and societal implications. If China becomes the world's largest economy, it could have a significant impact on the balance of power between China and the US, as well as the global economic system. It could also affect global trade, investment, and geopolitical relationships.\n\nRelationship between the terms:\nThe question is about the relationship between China and the US in terms of their GDP. It is asking whether China's economic growth will be faster than that of the US, leading to China overtaking the US in terms of GDP. This would require China's economy to continue growing at a fast pace, while the US economy would need to slow down or stagnate.\n\nWhy one term might impact another:\nChina's GDP growth is impacted by various factors, including government policies, investment, and trade. If China continues to promote policies that encourage economic growth and investment, it could potentially overtake the US in terms of GDP. On the other hand, if the US economy continues to grow at a steady pace, it could maintain its position as the world's largest economy.","examples":[{"example_question":"Will all local health districts in Virginia either be in declining or plateau trajectories OR report fewer than 5 cases per 100k residents per week for 3 consecutive weeks prior to 1 September 2021?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Before 2022, will Fluvoxamine receive authorization for treatment of Covid by the United States FDA before the end of the pandemic?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.45},{"example_question":"Will the 7-day moving average of current confirmed COVID-19 hospitalizations in Virginia cross 1,000 before June 10, 2022?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the 2020 Eurovision Song Contest be cancelled due to COVID-19?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Within any single calendar month in 2020, will at least 200,000 COVID-19 deaths, worldwide, be reported?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will variants of concerns thought to partially escape immunity make up more than 50% of samples sequenced in Virginia on 29 August - 11 September 2021?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will remdesivir be administered to at least 50,000 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections in the US, UK, EU member states, and Japan, by the end of 2020?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0},{"example_question":"Will the University of Pennsylvania send undergraduates back home Spring 2021?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"no","majority_predicted_answer":"A","uncertainty":0.35},{"example_question":"Will the US have more than 200,000 daily COVID-19 cases (7-day rolling average) before January 1, 2022?","example_choices":["yes","no"],"example_answer":"yes","majority_predicted_answer":"B","uncertainty":0.0,"example_context":"Entities:\n- US: The United States of America, a federal republic located in North America with 50 states and a population of approximately 331 million people.\n- COVID-19: A highly infectious respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus that was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019.\n\nDates:\n- January 1, 2022: The date by which the question is asking if the US will have more than 200,000 daily COVID-19 cases.\n\nDefinitions:\n- Daily COVID-19 cases: The number of new COVID-19 cases reported in a single day.\n- 7-day rolling average: A calculation of the average number of cases over the past 7 days, which is often used to smooth out daily fluctuations in data and provide a more accurate representation of trends over time.\n\nHistorical background:\n- COVID-19: The COVID-19 pandemic began in December 2019 and has since spread globally, infecting millions of people and causing hundreds of thousands of deaths.

The city was the first in the nation to issue a shelter-in-place order in March 2020, and it has implemented various restrictions on businesses and activities since then to slow the spread of the virus.\n- Indoor dining has been a particular area of concern during the pandemic, as it involves people removing their masks and spending extended periods of time in close proximity to one another, which increases the risk of transmission.\n- San Francisco has allowed indoor dining to resume with limited capacity and other safety measures in place, but the city has also imposed temporary bans on indoor dining in the past when COVID-19 cases have surged.\n\nImportant economic and societal considerations:\n- Banning indoor dining would have significant economic impacts on San Francisco's restaurant industry, which has already been hard-hit by the pandemic. Many restaurants have struggled to survive under the various restrictions and closures, and a ban on indoor dining could lead to more closures and job losses.\n- However, public health officials argue that such a ban may be necessary to slow the spread of COVID-19 and prevent more severe restrictions or lockdowns in the future.\n\nRelationship between terms:\n- San Francisco has the authority to issue health orders, which can include restrictions on activities like indoor dining.\n- The question is asking whether San Francisco will issue a health order banning all restaurant indoor dining during a specific time period.\n\nRank of importance:\n1.

As of 2021, the United States has the largest GDP in the world, while China has the second largest. However, some experts predict that China's GDP may overtake the US before 2030. This is due to China's rapid economic growth in recent years, as well as its large population and increasing technological advancements. However, others argue that the US still has a strong and innovative economy, and that it is unlikely that China will overtake the US in the near future. Ultimately, it is difficult to predict with certainty whether China's GDP will overtake the US before 2030."}
{"question":"Will an anti-discrimination law be enacted to protect U.S. federal employees who have been genetically-edited or screened as embryos by 2100?","id":"M9752","background":"Federal employees of the United States are protected from discriminative hiring practices by a host of difference acts and laws. Some of these, as detailed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and enforced by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), include Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 Equal Pay Act of 1963 Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 Rehabilitation Act of 1973 The Civil Rights Act of 1991 From the FTC The laws enforced by EEOC makes it unlawful for Federal agencies to discriminate against employees and job applicants on the bases of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, or age. A person who files a complaint or participates in an investigation of an EEO complaint, or who opposes an employment practice made illegal under any of the laws that EEOC enforces is protected from retaliation. Other protections exist as well, such as the Pregnancy Discrimination Act and Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008. Will an anti-discrimination law be enacted to protect U.S. federal employees who have been genetically-edited or screened as embryos by 2100? This question resolves positively if Congress, the EEOC or another federal U.S. agency creates act(s), law(s) or regulation making it unlawful to disciminate against employees based on whether they have been screen or edited as embryos by 2100. Terms such as or similar to \"gene-edited\", \"polygenically screened\", \"embryo selected\", or \"genetically modified\" will trigger a positive resolution. If no such act is instituted by 2100, this question resolves negatively.","publish_time":1644382800000,"close_time":"2055-01-01 05:00:00+00:00","tags":["Politics \u2013 US","Embryo Selection","Biological Sciences \u2013 Bioengineering","Effective Altruism","Economy \u2013 US"],"source_links":["https:\/\/www.ftc.gov\/site-information\/no-fear-act\/protections-against-discrimination","https:\/\/www.eeoc.gov\/pregnancy-discrimination","https:\/\/www.eeoc.gov\/statutes\/genetic-information-nondiscrimination-act-2008"],"prediction_count":34.0,"forecaster_count":19,"answer":null,"choices":["yes","no"],"status":"Active","qtype":"t\/f","crowd":[{"timestamp":"2022-02-09 05:16:52.927688+00:00","forecast":0.2},{"timestamp":"2022-02-09 05:18:50.464639+00:00","forecast":0.225},{"timestamp":"2022-02-09 12:54:36.296033+00:00","forecast":0.2},{"timestamp":"2022-02-09 13:20:58.405427+00:00","forecast":0.14},{"timestamp":"2022-02-09 14:53:38.145344+00:00","forecast":0.24},{"timestamp":"2022-02-09 16:04:23.618792+00:00","forecast":0.24},{"timestamp":"2022-02-09 16:14:47.232006+00:00","forecast":0.24},{"timestamp":"2022-02-10 00:37:40.140318+00:00","forecast":0.3},{"timestamp":"2022-02-10 08:04:11.658342+00:00","forecast":0.3},{"timestamp":"2022-02-11 22:41:21.122556+00:00","forecast":0.3},{"timestamp":"2022-02-11 22:41:27.904418+00:00","forecast":0.3},{"timestamp":"2022-02-11 22:54:05.696762+00:00","forecast":0.3},{"timestamp":"2022-02-13 03:38:22.252616+00:00","forecast":0.3},{"timestamp":"2022-02-14 02:19:28.825072+00:00","forecast":0.3},{"timestamp":"2022-02-16 18:17:31.056679+00:00","forecast":0.3},{"timestamp":"2022-02-17 06:22:38.600399+00:00","forecast":0.24},{"timestamp":"2022-02-17 08:04:09.414541+00:00","forecast":0.24},{"timestamp":"2022-02-21 16:16:16.890198+00:00","forecast":0.24},{"timestamp":"2022-02-22 01:30:49.693236+00:00","forecast":0.3},{"timestamp":"2022-02-22 04:32:00.070010+00:00","forecast":0.5},{"timestamp":"2022-02-22 08:04:12.885878+00:00","forecast":0.5},{"timestamp":"2022-03-02 01:06:32.379543+00:00","forecast":0.5},{"timestamp":"2022-03-23 23:51:48.610422+00:00","forecast":0.5},{"timestamp":"2022-04-24 14:48:05.369207+00:00","forecast":0.5},{"timestamp":"2022-05-01 17:35:44.528067+00:00","forecast":0.5},{"timestamp":"2022-05-07 15:21:28.872325+00:00","forecast":0.5},{"timestamp":"2022-05-07 15:21:37.368161+00:00","forecast":0.5},{"timestamp":"2022-06-05 06:57:02.907684+00:00","forecast":0.47},{"timestamp":"2022-06-05 08:04:51.906354+00:00","forecast":0.47},{"timestamp":"2022-06-07 18:23:43.509165+00:00","forecast":0.47},{"timestamp":"2022-06-11 05:20:08.399692+00:00","forecast":0.47},{"timestamp":"2022-06-12 05:14:12.894465+00:00","forecast":0.47},{"timestamp":"2022-06-12 23:26:58.803864+00:00","forecast":0.47},{"timestamp":"2022-06-14 02:07:14.980025+00:00","forecast":0.47}],"avg_pred":0.3586764706,"median_pred":0.3,"majority_pred":0.3,"pred_taken":0.3,"acceptable_pred_lower_boundary":0.1,"acceptable_pred_upper_boundary":0.5,"context":"Entities:\n- Anti-discrimination law: A law that prohibits discrimination against certain groups of people based on protected characteristics such as race, gender, religion, or disability.\n- U.S. federal employees: People who work for the federal government in the United States.\n- Genetically-edited or screened as embryos: A process where scientists can manipulate the genes of embryos to create desired traits or screen for genetic disorders.\n\nDates:\n- 2100: The year in which the question asks if an anti-discrimination law will be enacted.\n\nLocations:\n- United States: The country where the federal employees in question work.\n\nImportant economic or societal considerations:\n- Genetic editing and screening raise ethical concerns regarding the creation of \"designer babies\" and the potential for widening societal inequalities based on access to these technologies.\n- Discrimination based on genetic traits could have significant impacts on employment opportunities, healthcare access, and other aspects of life.\n\nRelationships between terms:\n- The question posits a potential future scenario in which genetic editing and screening are commonplace enough to warrant legal protections against discrimination.\n- An anti-discrimination law would likely impact the hiring and treatment of genetically-edited or screened federal employees, and could have broader societal implications for how genetic traits are valued and treated.\n\nRank of importance:\n1.

considers the impact of taxes, non-cash benefits (such as food stamps and housing subsidies), and necessary expenses (such as healthcare and childcare) on a family's income and poverty status.\n- The SPM is updated annually to reflect changes in the cost of living and government assistance programs.\n\nRelationship between terms:\n- The US Supplemental Poverty Measure is impacted by factors such as government assistance programs and cost of living differences across regions of the country.\n- Changes in these factors can impact the SPM from year to year.\n\nRank of importance:\n- US Supplemental Poverty Measure: Extremely important, as it is the central focus of the question.\n- Poverty: Very important, as it is the societal issue that the SPM seeks to measure.\n- Government assistance programs: Important, as they are a factor that impacts poverty and the SPM.\n- Cost of living: Important, as it is a factor that impacts poverty and the SPM.","examples":[{"example_question":"Before 22 July 2021, will Hamas or the Israeli government accuse the other of violating the Gaza ceasefire agreed to on 20 May

{"question":"Will the Federal Reserve ever adopt a policy regime that implements nominal GDP targeting or nominal wage targeting?","id":"M10459","background":"For background, policies of \u201cinflation targeting\u201d have dominated in developed country central banks for the last three or four decades, implicitly or explicitly. Under this policy, central banks explicitly aim for some target rate of inflation (or target range) each year, For example: the ECB, as of 2021, has a symmetric, medium-term 2% inflation target; the Fed has since the 1990s been thought to operate under an implicit inflation target of 2%, which it formalized in a 2012 statement. More recently, the Fed has adopted a policy which has become known as \"flexible average inflation targeting\", where it has stated or implied a willingness to allow inflation to go somewhat above 2% if inflation had been below 2% in the recent past; and vice versa for recent inflation overshoots. Economic theory predicts that this sort of \u201cmake-up policy\u201d, compared to the prior policy of implicitly \u201cletting bygones be bygones\u201d, is very beneficial for avoiding recessions \u2013 particularly at the ZLB \u2013 by anchoring expectations for the future price level. Some economists argue that the Fed should make a more significant change to its policy framework, and focus on nominal GDP growth rather than inflation. Nominal GDP growth is equal to (by definition) the sum of inflation and real GDP growth: NGDP \u27f9\u0394NGDP = P \ue152 \ue153 \ue151\ue150 price level \u22c5 Y \ue152 \ue153 \ue151\ue150 real GDP = \u0394P \ue152 \ue153 \ue151\ue150 inflation + \u0394Y \ue152 \ue153 \ue151\ue150 real GDP growth For example, the Fed might target 4% NGDP growth each year, expecting on average 2% growth in real GDP and therefore 2% inflation on average. Under NGDP targeting, the central bank would allow inflation to rise when real growth is low (and vice versa). Many economists argue that such a policy would better prevent economic fluctuations (particularly at the ZLB) but also more generally. For more on NGDP targeting, see: [1], [2], [3], [4]. A similar, but slightly different alternative policy regime would target stable growth in nominal wages. Under nominal wage targeting, the central bank would aim for stable growth in an index of nominal wages in the economy. For example, the Fed might target 3.5% annual growth in an appropriate index of nominal wages, reflecting expectations for on average 1.5% growth in labor productivity and 2% inflation. For more on nominal wage targeting, see: [1], [2], [3]. Will the Federal Reserve ever adopt a policy regime that implements nominal GDP targeting or nominal wage targeting? The question resolves as yes on the date that the Federal Reserve announces a policy regime that implements NGDP targeting; or as no on January 1, 2050, whichever comes first. This information is taken from (e.g.) the press releases available on the Federal Reserve\u2019s website.

Nominal GDP targeting: A monetary policy framework in which the central bank targets a specific level of nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate.\n3. Nominal wage targeting: A monetary policy framework in which the central bank targets a specific level of nominal wage growth rate.\n\nHistorical Background:\nThe Federal Reserve was established in 1913, and its primary responsibility is to promote maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The Federal Reserve has primarily used inflation targeting as its monetary policy framework since the early 1990s. However, nominal GDP targeting and nominal wage targeting have gained attention among economists and policymakers in recent years as alternative monetary policy frameworks.\n\nBackground on Important Economic or Societal Considerations:\nNominal GDP targeting and nominal wage targeting have the potential to stabilize both inflation and employment. Nominal GDP targeting may be effective in situations where there is a supply-side shock, such as an oil price shock. Nominal wage targeting may be effective in situations where there is a demand-side shock, such as a recession. However, these frameworks also have potential drawbacks, including the difficulty of accurately measuring GDP and wages and the possibility of unintended consequences.\n\nRelationship between Terms:\nNominal GDP targeting and nominal wage targeting are both alternative monetary policy frameworks that the Federal Reserve could potentially adopt.

{"question":"Will the TSA extend or reimpose a mask mandate on public transportation before 2024?","id":"M10490","background":"Mask mandates were widely introduced following the coronavirus pandemic. Yet, because of vaccines, natural immunity, and effective anti-virals, many people now believe that the virus poses only a minor risk to life and health, and thus, wish to return to a normal life. As of March 2022 in the United States, nearly all private and public institutions appear to have dropped their mask mandates, or are planning on doing so shortly. However, the federal Transportation Security Administration (TSA) appears to be among the last holdouts of this wave of normality. On March 10th, the TSA announced that they were extending the mask mandate on public transportation, in consultation with the CDC, until April 18th. It remains to be seen whether this mandate will be extended again, perhaps due to the BA.2 variant, or reimposed as cases rise again next winter. Will the TSA extend or reimpose a mask mandate on public transportation before 2024? This question resolves positively if the TSA announces via any credible medium that at least some passengers in the United States are required to wear masks on ANY form of public transportation before 2024, following the current April 18th deadline when the current mandate is scheduled to expire. Otherwise, it resolves negatively.

It has been detected first in the UK on January 19, 2022, then in Brazil, Australia, Thailand, India, and Israel. 1,125 cases of Omicron XE have been identified in the UK, as of April 5, 2022. On March 25, 2022, Susan Hopkins of the UK Health Security Agency stated: This particular recombinant, XE, has shown a variable growth rate and we cannot yet confirm whether it has a true growth advantage. So far there is not enough evidence to draw conclusions about transmissibility, severity or vaccine effectiveness. Will Omicron XE be the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the US before June 19, 2022? This question will resolve as Yes if, before June 19, 2022, the Omicron XE SARS-CoV-2 variant makes up more than 50% of COVID-19 cases in the US, as estimated by the CDC COVID variant Nowcast. The two most recent weeks reported in the Nowcast are based on preliminary data and the model's forecast; to resolve this question as Yes, qualifying data must be at least 2 weeks
